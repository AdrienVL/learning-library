# Introduction 

NetFoundry helps you spin up automated, zero trust, network-as-code connections between Oracle Cloud and any other location without waiting for infrastructure, MPLS, or VPNs. This gives the business unprecedented speed, agility, and security with a cloud-based Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) built on the principles of Gen 2 Cloud (elastic, autonomous and secure by design).

With increased focus on zero trust architecture, Oracle partners with NetFoundry to help transform your network and set the foundation for your long-term work from anywhere and zero trust networking strategy. To understand NetFoundry’s implementation of the zero trust access from the NIST 800-207 standard, refer to this [whitepaper](https://netfoundry.io/resources/netfoundry-and-nist-white-paper/).

As the incredible events of 2020 continue into 2021, NetFoundry continues to innovate for the Enterprise of the future with enhancements to our Work from Home platform and develop innovative solutions for connecting to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Your employees gain seamless connectivity to applications from anywhere, while advancing your overall security posture. Embed security and performance into your company’s core business applications. Policy-based access controls and micro-segmentation enable you to proactively manage all user connections, ensuring that employees, partners, and contractors can only access resources they’re entitled to and nothing else.

Because NetFoundry is offered as a service, organizations can realize the agility and flexibility benefits of zero trust networking access in a fraction of the time and cost of implementing traditional VPNs or SD-WAN solutions. Ultimately, NetFoundry can transform your networking infrastructure and accelerate employee productivity in the next phase. The NetFoundry software is staged within the OCI Marketplace for easy deployment within any customer OCI region.
