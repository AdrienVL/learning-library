Estimated Lab Time: 45 minutes

### About Identity and Access Management (IAM)
The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Identity and Access Management (IAM) Service allows you to control who has access to your cloud resources. You control the types of access a group of users has and to which specific resources. 

### Objectives

The purpose of this lab is to give you an overview of the IAM Service components and an example scenario to help you understand how they work together.

In this lab, you will:
* Sign-in to your OCI Tenancy to access the Console
* Verify the Service Limit
* Manage access by creating 
    - Demo Compartment
    - OCI Group
    - Policies
    - New Local User


### Prerequisites

* To sign in to the Console, you need the following: 

    - Tenant, Username and Password
    - URL for the Console: [https://cloud.oracle.com] (https://cloud.oracle.com)
