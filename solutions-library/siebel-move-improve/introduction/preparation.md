## **STEP 2:** Generate a Secure Shell (SSH) Key Pair

### FOR MAC/LINUX

**NOTE:**  If you have a previously generated key available, you can use that key and skip this exercise

Generate ssh-keys for your machine if you don’t have one. If an id_rsa and id_rsa.pub key pair is present, they can be reused. By default, these are stored in ~/.ssh folder. 

Enter the following command if you are using MAC or Linux Desktop:  

    
    # ssh-keygen

Make sure permissions are restricted, sometimes ssh will fail if private keys have permissive permissions. Enter the following to ensure this.

    # chmod 0700 ~/.ssh  
    # chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa  
    # chmod 0644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

## FOR WINDOWS

There are many tools available for Windows users to create SSH key pairs and connect to a Linux server.  In this guide, we provide instructions for both Git Bash and Putty, but you only need to follow the steps below for either Git Bash ***OR*** Putty, but not both

### Git Bash:

1)  Install Git for windows if not already Installed. Download the latest release of [Git](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/) for Windows and install accepting all the default settings.

2)  Open Git Bash by either checking the ***Launch Git Bash*** option in the installer ***OR*** by navigating to it from the Windows Start Menu:

   ![](./images/lab1_gitsetup.png " ")
   ![](./images/lab1_gitbash.png " ")

3)  Generate ssh-keys by the command ssh-keygen in Git Bash and then simply hit “Enter” for all steps:

    ssh-keygen  
    Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key

    (/c/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa): (Press enter for this step)
    Created directory '/c/Users/username/.ssh'.

    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): (Press enter for this step)

    Enter same passphrase again: (Press enter for this step)
    Your identification has been saved in /c/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.  
    Your public key has been saved in /c/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

    **Note:**

    •   In Git Bash, C:\Users\username\ is shown as /c/Users/username/

    •   These instructions will create a minimally secure ssh key for you (and one well suited for this tutorial). For production environments we recommend an SSH-2 RSA key with 4096 bits and a passphrase. For example: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N "<myPassphrase>" -f ~/keys/id_rsa -C "This is my comment"

### Puttygen

1)  Install Puttygen (PUTTY) for Windows if not already installed. Download the latest release of [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), 64-bit MSI Installer and install accepting all the default settings

2)  Open PuTTY Gen: 

![](./images/lab1_puttygen.png " ")

3)  In the PuTTY Key Generator, ensure that the ***Type of key to generate*** is set to ***RSA*** and the Number of bits in a generated key is set to ***2048***, and then click the ***Generate*** button
 
![](./images/lab1_puttykey.png " ")

4)  After clicking the ***Generate button***, move the mouse around the blank area to generate randomness for the SSH key to be generated
 
![](./images/lab1_keygenerator.png " ")

5)  In the PuTTY Key Generator dialog, select all the characters in the ***Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file*** field, and then right-click and select ***Copy***

**Note:** Ensure that you select all the characters and not just the ones shown in the narrow window. Scroll down as necessary
 
![](./images/lab1_copykey.png " ")

6)  Paste the copied string into a plain text editor (such as Notepad) and save the plain text file. Save it to a known location with any file name but ensure that it has the extension .pub (example: OCISSHKey.pub) to indicate that it is a public key.  Make note of this file name as you will need it later

7)  Next, save the OpenSSH private key. In the same PuTTY Key Generator window, from the ***Conversions*** menu, select the ***Export OpenSSH key*** option.

![](./images/lab1_exportkey.png " ")

8)  PuTTYgen will ask you to verify that the key will be saved without a passphrase. Click the ***Yes*** button.
 
![](./images/lab1_puttyyes.png " ")

9)  Again, save the file to the same known location with any file name but ensure that the file has ***NO extension*** on it (example: OCISSHKey).  Make note of this file name as you will need it later.

10) Save the Windows private key. In the same PuTTY Key Generator window, click the ***Save private key*** button. 
 
![](./images/lab1_puttyprivatekey.png " ")

11) Again, click the ***Yes*** button to verify saving the key without a passphrase.

12) Save this file to the same known location with any file name and a .ppk extension (example: OCISSHKey.ppk).

## Summary
At this point, everything is allocated and generated to start creating instances and in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
