# Conda Environment  

## Introduction

When you log into OCI Data Science, you will be able to to pick and choose which conda environment you want to use in your notebook session from a list of pre-built conda environments or create, install and publish your own environments.

A conda environment is somewhere between a Docker image and a Python virtual environment. It allows users to run processes in isolated environments with different packages and different package versions installed.   In addition, it can manage different versions of Python that are not installed system-wide and support package installation of Python, R, Node.js and Java.  For many ML and AI use cases, conda environments offer the right level of isolation and flexibility.
