# Introduction

## What is OCI Streaming

[Oracle Cloud Infrastrucutre Streaming](https://www.oracle.com/cloud-native/streaming/) is a real-time, managed service, Apache Kafka-compatible event streaming platform for developers and data scientists.OCI Streaming provides a fully managed, scalable, and durable messaging solution for ingesting continuous, high-volume streams of data that you can consume and process in real time. Streaming is tightly integrated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), Database, GoldenGate, and Integration Cloud.  The service also provides out-of-the-box integrations for hundreds of third-party products across categories such as DevOps, databases, big data, and SaaS applications.



## Why OCI Streaming

### Serverless infrastructure

***Elastic and scalable platform***

Data engineers can easily set up and operate big data pipelines. Oracle handles all infrastructure and platform management for event streaming, including provisioning, scaling, and security patching.

 ***Deploy streaming apps at scale***

With the help of consumer groups, Streaming can provide state management for thousands of consumers. This helps developers easily build applications at scale.

***Oracle Cloud Infrastructure integrations***

Native integrations with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services include Object Storage for long-term storage, Monitoring for observability, Resource Manager for deploying at scale, and Tagging for easier cost tracking/account management.

***Kafka Connect Harness***

The Kafka Connect Harness provides out-of-the-box integrations with hundreds of data sources and sinks, including GoldenGate, Integration Cloud, Database, and compatible third-party offerings.
