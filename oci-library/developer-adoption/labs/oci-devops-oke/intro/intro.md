# Introduction

## Automating the Deployment of Java Apps to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

You will learn how to build a Java application, containerize your application, and automate the deployment using Kubernetes (K8s) with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) DevOps. This lab will also cover CI/CD security and ways to automate your release process with DevOps pipelines.

Estimated time: 1h:30 minutes


## Cloud Native Applications

According to Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF):

"Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.The Software architects understand the benefits of running scalable applications adecided to use Kubernetes to build their Cloud Native solution."


## Oracle DevOps

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure DevOps service provides an end-to-end CI/CD platform for developers. It includes *Deployment Pipelines* to automate your software delivery, and deployment process targeting OCI services: 
- Oracle Container Engine for Kurbernetes (OKE)
- Oracle Functions (Fn)
- Compute instances

Automating software releases with Deployment Pipelines increases developer productivity and allows you to release features more frequently and with fewer errors. It helps avoid downtime during deployments and automates the complexity of updating applications. Oracle DevOps can be used by both customers migrating workloads to OCI (from on-prem or other clouds) and customers developing new applications on OCI.

OCI DevOps offers many deployment strategies to meet your needs â€“ you can perform rolling updates, as well as Blue/Green (also called A/B) and Canary release strategies. With the ability to rollback a deployment coupled with support for various release strategies, Deployment Pipelines provides the capability to minimize the blast radius due to a bad deployment. You can get started with a deployment with the OCI DevOps using existing 3rd party CI platforms leveraging plugins, as well as via CLI and SDKs.


## Role Play Scenario

You are leading a company to build a new e-commerce cloud native application using microservices architecture, Kubernetes and you want to automate the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to quickly innovate, delivery new features to customers constantly and faster. There is a Developers team that is responsible for building and testing the application. There is also a SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) team that will be responsible for managing the infrastructure and operations to ensure the business can meet their Service Level Objective (SLO).

During this lab you will play both Developers and SREs roles and will perform the following activities: 

As a developer:

- write code (Java, helm charts) and tests
- push code to a git repository (`application_dev` repository)
- write K8s manifest files for deploying the application
- push K8s manifest code to a git repository (`deploy` repository)
- create pull/merge request from feature branches to main branch in both repositories.
- run Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines (test, package and publish docker image)


As a SRE:
- write Infrastructure As Code (IaC) and provision the infrastructure
- push IaC to a git repository (deploy repository)
- approve/reject pull/merge requests into main branch of `deploy`repository
- approve and onboard applications (new namespace) into the K8s cluster through an automated Continous Delivery (CD) pipeline
- write K8s manifest files for deploying services/endpoints/security used by application
- rollout new features/services through the Continous Delivery pipeline
- rollback to the latest successful pipeline in case of failures
