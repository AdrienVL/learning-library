# Introduction

## Java applications on OCI Arm A1 compute platform

Learn how to build and deploy Java applications as containers on the OCI Arm A1 compute platform. You will deploy a Todo application with a database as containers running on the OCI Arm A1 compute platform. Additonally, you will use the new set of container tools such as [Podman](podman.io) that are part of the container tools 

Estimated time: 45 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create an OCI Arm A1 compute instance 
* Build a Java EE application that manages Todo notes.
* Deploy the application to Tomcat 9
* Connect the application to a database and manage the deployment as a Pod. 
* Run and test the application
* Clean up the deployments

### Prerequisites

1. An Oracle Free Tier(Trial), Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
1. [Familiarity with OCI console](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/console.htm)
1. [Overview of Networking](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Network/Concepts/overview.htm)
1. [Familiarity with Compartments](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/concepts.htm)
1. Basic conceptual knowledge of containers and [Podman](https://podman.io/)

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
