## Connectivity Issues? Applications Hanging? Connected To A VPN?
While connected to a VPN, some ports in your network may be closed to traffic. Tools like the Oracle Analytics Tool will often be unable to establish a connection with your database while connected to a VPN. Uploading data to a database may be jeopardized as well.

Please disconnect from your VPN and try again.
