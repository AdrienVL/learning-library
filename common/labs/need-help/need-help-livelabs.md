## Can't Create An Oracle Database? Nothing In Your Compartment?
Ensure that under "List Scope", you are selecting the compartment provided to you in the lab banner. If you can't find your compartment in the drop-down box, make sure you set your region to the one provided in the lab banner.

## Connectivity Issues? Unable To Upload Data or Connect To The database?
Are you connected to a **VPN**, **Corporate Network**, or behind a strict **Firewall**?

If any of these three conditions are true, some ports in your network may be closed to traffic. Uploading data through Database Actions in your web browser and applications like the Oracle Analytics Tool could be restricted and may appear to "Hang" or freeze. 

Please disconnect from your VPN and try again if applicable.

If you are connected to a corporate network, try switching to a public or a "clear" network if allowed.

Alternatively, contact your IT Administrator to see if adding exceptions to your network or firewall would be viable.
