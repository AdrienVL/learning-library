# Uploading a custom visual extension

## Introduction

When we introduced Oracle Analytics Server at the beginning of this workshop we talked about how the platform gives you choice and flexibility in your deployment. The feature we will now explore in more detail is the ability to upload custom visualizations and analytics scripts. We will do this by leveraging some of the pre-built examples from the Oracle Analytics Library.
