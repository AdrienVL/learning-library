# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Thiss workshop is designed to illustrate how organizations can blend the capabilities found in both of these offerings to uncover value across the entire data lifecycle in a way that holistically meets the needs of both **citizen & professional** data scientists. 


### About Product/Technology
Oracle Analytics Server (OAS) is a comprehensive enterprise analytics solution that empowers you to ask any question – of any data – in any environment – on any device.   The extensive augmented analytic capabilities surfaced throughout the product truly differentiate it from other analytic offerings.  These augmented analytics are designed to enable and support the needs of “citizen” data scientists.

Oracle Converged Database affords native support for all modern data types as well as supporting the latest development paradigms from a singular product. Most customers think of the Oracle database as a traditional relational database, but recent releases also offer support for:
* Spatial data to support location awareness  
* JSON for document stores  
* IoT for device integration  
* In-Memory technologies for real-time analytic  
* Machine Learning   

What a great many customers don’t realize is these capabilities are now included free with every Oracle database license.   The Machine Learning capabilities within the Oracle Database are designed to enable and support the more robust and demanding needs of **professional** data scientists.

 

### Objectives
This lab will introduce you to the capability OAS to readily add augmented analytic functions such as Trendline, Forecast, Cluster & Outlier identification to your analysis.In lab5 you will play the role of an HR Analyst.  The VP of HR has noticed an increasing rate of attrition.  As an analyst, you have been tasked with identifying what is happening internally in order to decrease the rate of attrition and identify potential strategies to mitigate risk. Additionally, you will identify those employees who are at greatest risk for leaving.

And in lab6, you will play the role of a data scientist assisting the HR Analyst within your organization. The analyst has asked you to assist in evaluating what ML algorithms are best suited to understanding and preventing unwanted attrition in order to decrease the rate of attrition and identify potential strategies to mitigate risk.   Additionally, you will identify employees still with the organization who are at greatest risk for leaving.
