# Introduction

## About Oracle Spatial Studio

Oracle’s mission is to help people see data in new ways, discover insights, and unlock endless possibilities. Spatial analysis is about understanding complex interactions based on geographic relationships – answering questions based on where people, assets, and resources are located. Spatial insights enable you to provide better customer service, optimize your workforce, locate retail and distribution centers, evaluate sales and marketing campaigns, and more. With Oracle’s spatial offerings, developers, database professionals, and analysts leverage a comprehensive suite of spatial data management, analytics, and visualization tools to integrate spatial analysis and mapping into applications and workflows. 

The spatial capabilitieis of Oracle Database have historically required coding and/or use of 3rd party tools.

### Workshop Overview

In this workshop you will create and configure spatial data and perform some basic spatial queries.  The scenario involves WAREHOUSES, BRANCHES, and a COASTAL\_ZONE. The WAREHOUSES and BRANCHES are points, and the COASTAL\_ZONE is a polygon. You will create and configure these spatial tables, and then perform spatial queries to identify items on proximity and containment.
