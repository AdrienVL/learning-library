# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop provides insights regarding the true meaning of a **Converged Database**. We'll start from the JSON data 
type perspective but quickly introduce the industry standard to combine JSON data with Relational data.

The learning curve is based on true use cases introduced as if you were a developer working for a fictive e-commerce startup.
