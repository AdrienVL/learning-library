# Initialize Environment

## Introduction

This lab provides detailed instructions of connecting to Essbase 21c using Web UI. This machine comes with Essbase installed and configured with Oracle database and also starts its services on its own start-up.

*Estimated Lab Time:* 10 Minutes.

### Objectives
- Initialize the workshop environment.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- SSH Private Key to access the host via SSH
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Generate SSH Keys (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Environment Setup

## **STEP 1**: Login To Oracle Essbase 21c Web UI
The administrator interface for Essbase 21c is web based. The cubes can be created and managed through the web interface.

This lab has been designed to be executed end-to-end with any modern browser on your laptop or workstation. Proceed as detailed below to login.

### UI Access
1. Launch your browser to the following URL to access Oracle Essbase 21c UI.  

    ```
    <copy>http://[Instance-public-ip]:9000/essbase/jet</copy>
    ```
    
    ![](./images/ess-environment1.png " ")

***Note:*** While application processes are automatically started upon instance boot up, it takes approximately 15 minutes for this URL to become active after all processes have fully started. If the URL remains inactive even after 15 minutes, refer to **Step 2** below for manual start-up.

2. Login with the below credentials.
    ```
    Username	: <copy>Weblogic</copy>
    ```

    ```
    Password	: <copy>Oracle_4U</copy>
    ````

## **STEP 2:** Download and Stage Workshop Artifacts


1. Download [`essbase_21c_labfiles.zip`](./files/essbase_21c_labfiles.zip) and save to a staging area on your laptop or workstation.

2. Uncompress the ZIP archive.


## **STEP 3**: Login to Host for manual startup (Optional)
While you will only need the browser to perform all tasks included in this workshop, you can optionally use your preferred SSH client to connect to the instance to perform any troubleshooting task such as restarting processes, rebooting the instance, or just look around.

### Start Script

​Your workshop instance is configured to start all processes automatically needed for the labs. Perform these steps only if you are unable to launch Essbase 21c UI in **Step1**.

1. Launch your browser to the following URL to access noVnc web UI.
   
    ```
    <copy>http://[Instance-public-ip]:6080/index.html?resize=remote</copy>
    ```
   ​![](./images/ess-environment2.png " ")

2. Click Connect and enter the password.

    ```
    Password	:<copy>LiveLabs.Rocks_99</copy>
    ```

3.  Open the terminal on the desktop and go to folder /u01/scripts to find the manual startup script.

    ```
    <copy>cd /u01/scripts/</copy>
    ```

    Use clipboard on the left menu for copy paste. Paste on the clipboard and use shift+Insert key on the terminal.
