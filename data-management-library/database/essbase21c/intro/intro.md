### About Product/Technology

Lines of business are under enormous pressure to generate more insights, faster, from their financial systems and other critical data sources. But for most organizations, far too much time is spent manually sourcing, managing, preparing, and securing data – leaving far too little time for true analysis and insight.

Oracle Essbase is a business analytics solution that uses a proven, flexible, best-in-class architecture for analysis, reporting, and collaboration. Essbase delivers instant value and greater productivity for your business users, analysts, modelers, and decision-makers, across all lines of business within your organization.

Oracle Essbase helps you to build your company’s On-Premise strategy efficiently by avoiding data and business process fragmentation. Oracle Essbase can be easily deployed on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, which can then be widely used to solve simple to complex business analytics use cases across all industries. It is designed to help you model business performance levels and deliver what-if analyses for varying conditions.
