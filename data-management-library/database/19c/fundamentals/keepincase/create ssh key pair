## **STEP 1**: Create an SSH key pair

1. On the toolbar in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, click the **Cloud Shell** icon to open the Cloud Shell window, and wait for a terminal prompt to be displayed at the bottom of the page.

2. Create a `.ssh` directory to store your private key.

    ```nohighlighting
    $ <copy>mkdir .ssh</copy>
    ```

3. Set permissions on the `.ssh` directory so that only you (the owner) can read, write, and execute on the directory. Also set permissions on the private key itself so that only you (the owner) can read and write (but not execute) on the private key file.

  *REVIEWER*: Is this needed? I think you need to make sure the private key has chmod 600 * applied to it

    ```nohighlighting

    $ <copy>chmod 700 ~/.ssh</copy>
    $ <copy>cd .ssh</copy>
    $ <copy>chmod 600 *</copy>
    ```


4. While you are in the `.ssh` directory, generate an SSH key pair. This lab specifies `cloudshellkey` as the key name, however, you can use any name you like. When prompted, press **Enter** to not enter a passphrase.

    ```nohighlighting
    $ <copy>ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f cloudshellkey

    Generating public/private rsa key pair.
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved in cloudshellkey.
    Your public key has been saved in cloudshellkey.pub.
    The key fingerprint is:
    SHA256:EJBYzyxwwHi9y4jc+pqWVjSvFtiv2xmj+K9C4IovcSY jody_glove@2ff9ae3459e2
    The key's randomart image is:
    +---[RSA 2048]----+
    | oo=+o.          |
    |. +oo+ .         |
    | .  ..=          |
    |.  o.. .         |
    |+.=oo.  S        |
    |E=+=o.           |
    |+=+ +o           |
    |+*ooo.+          |
    |o*BB=+           |
    +----[SHA256]-----+</copy>
    ```

5. Confirm the private key and public key files exist in the `.ssh` directory. In this example, there is a private key named `cloudshellkey` and a public key named `cloudshellkey.pub`. For security reasons, it's important that you keep the private key safe and don't share its content with anyone.

    ```nohighlighting
    $ <copy>ls</copy>

    cloudshellkey  cloudshellkey.pub
    ```

6. Show the contents of the public key. It starts with `ssh-rsa`.

    ```nohighlighting
    $ <copy>cat cloudshellkey.pub</copy>

    ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDqs9uly7HqmiJlaSQmgJ8gmJ65avZt5KBGN+kgcgxKDbLdmVqaN0Ois3vnrMeHYN+gHFp2qRM4RV7bAwbrHaTo6PqAhqMqmF/k5o5c23/+WlL+HUOS00UXBBYLVz2v2kz3dq10E7zwX68DKqaBRo5iPSoLGssh2lWq8yTMFnD04nma5DSzV5LpIa9bWTaUU4jVGVhvAdX+832yOfzflkEWdaaX6rh17t6IuY5aiOWgDJmdNQouXsmqDHFS98tJFqmNDzrx7qL5tP0q0HzcQ7BNkdWamy1znwJBiRferLGzlLvOEEDpjgTzmgRKzeoLieFACQh+iXbTJ4jfyTrP9va1jody_glove@2ff9ae3459e2
    ```

7. Copy the contents of the public key to the clipboard and save it somewhere (for example, in NotePad++) for later. Make sure you remove any hard returns that sometimes get added when copying text. The public key needs to be all on one line.

  Tip: In NotePad++, you can view hard returns by selecting **View**, then **Show Symbol**, and then **Show All Characters**.
