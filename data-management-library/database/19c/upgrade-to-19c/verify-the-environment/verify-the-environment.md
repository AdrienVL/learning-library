# Connect to the 19c database Hands-On-Lab Environment #

Since we are going to work with upgrading databases, we have prepared an image with several sources database already setup. This image is accessible through Remote Desktop NoVNC application and runs in the Oracle OCI Cloud.

## Requirements ##

To complete this lab, you need the following account credentials and assets:

- Oracle PTS 19c Lab environment
	- This environment has been pre-setup by the Livelabs environment
	- Your IP address is visible in the Livelabs -> Launch Workshop page
	- The URL to the NoVNC Remote Desktop is also visible in this screen

## Connect to the Hands-On Lab client image using NoVNC ##

Click on the supplied link on the LiveLabs Attendee Page. A new browser window should open and show you a running Linux desktop like this:

### Suggestion ####

It is easier to cut-and-paste values from the Hands-On Labs if the Hands-On Lab document is open in the same desktop/environment as the prompt where you want to paste. We therefore highly recommend you  to

- Make the remote Linux desktop full screen
- Open a new browser window inside the Linux Desktop Environment
- Navigate to Oracle Livelabs, log in and go to My Reservations to Launch this workshop

## Optional: Using SSH to connect to the image ##

By default, the SSH ports are enabled and the SSH daemon is running in the image so you can connect your favorite SSH client to the image as well for all non-graphical steps in the labs.

> **The ssh server only accepts public/private key authentication. <br>
> It is NOT allowed to change the authentication method to accept passwords !**

You are allowed to add your own public key to the `authorized_keys` file in the image.
It is out of the scope of this hands-on lab to demonstrate how to do this.

## Next step: Lab 1 - Install 19c ##

**All labs depend on the 19c installation in lab 1**

- There is no dependency between the labs after lab 1
- Please continue with your hands-on experience by running the steps in Lab 1.
- After finishing Lab 1, continue as instructed to the next Lab or choose an interesting lab
	- If one lab is executing the upgrade, you can start another Lab if you want to
	- Every Lab has its own instances and versions so even the upgrade can run in parallel
