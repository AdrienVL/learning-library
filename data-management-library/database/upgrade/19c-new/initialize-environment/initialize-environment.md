## Introduction

In this lab we will review and startup all components required to successfully run this workshop.

*Estimated Lab Time:* 10 Minutes.

### Objectives
- Initialize the workshop environment.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- A Free Tier, Paid or LiveLabs Oracle Cloud account
- SSH Private Key to access the host via SSH
- You have completed:
    - Lab: Generate SSH Keys (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Prepare Setup (*Free-tier* and *Paid Tenants* only)
    - Lab: Environment Setup

## **STEP 1:** Validate That Required Processes are Up and Running.
1. Now with access to your remote desktop session, proceed as indicated below to validate your environment before you start executing the subsequent labs. The following Processes should be up and running:

    - Database Listener
    - Database Server

2. Confirm successful login. Please note that it takes about 5 minutes after instance provisioning for all processes to fully start.

    The host is preconfigured to automatically start a database listener and 4 databases upon startup.
