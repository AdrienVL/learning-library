is a heavily wood-aged wine with a bitter character redeemed by the ripe blackberry fruits from a blend of 65% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Cabernet Franc. It is structured, with firm tannins over the fresh and juicy fruitiness. Give the wine another year and the two will come into balance.

Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tCave B 2012 Malbec (Columbia Valley (WA))\tMalbec\tCave B\n30336\tFrance\tThis ripe wine is firm, with a core of dry tannins.

It's dry with red plum and black currant freshness. Drink from 2016.\tClos Mazurique\t88\t17\tLoire Valley\tSaumur\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCh?�teau de Br??z?? 2012 Clos Mazurique  (Saumur)\tCabernet Franc\tCh?�teau de Br??z??\n30338\tFrance\tA blend of Mauzac and Loin de l'Oeil, commonly found in Gaillac, this bright, fruity and herbaceous wine is crisp and citrus-driven. A strong mineral edge to the texture adds bite to the aftertaste. Drink from 2015.\tLes Jacquaires\t88\t25\tFrance Other\tVin de France\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCh?�teau la Colombi??re 2014 Les Jacquaires White (Vin de France)\tWhite Blend\tCh?�teau la Colombi??re\n30339\tFrance\tDominated by Sauvignon Blanc, this wine has a still young, crisp, tight character. As it ages, the yellow fruits and ripe plum flavors will come through, balancing the acidity and giving a ripe, full and generous wine. Drink from 2016.\t\t88\t15\tBordeaux\tGraves\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCh?�teau les Clauzots 2014  Graves\tBordeaux-style White Blend\tCh?�teau les Clauzots\n30340\tItaly\tAromas of underbrush, baked earth, oak, coffee, mature dark-skinned berry and a whiff of eucalyptus lead the nose. The firm, straightforward palate offers tart cherry, espresso, toast and menthol alongside fine-grained tannins.\tCamp du Rouss\t88\t20\tPiedmont\tBarbera d'Asti\t\tKerin O�??Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tCoppo 2012 Camp du Rouss  (Barbera d'Asti)\tBarbera\tCoppo\n30341\tUS\tThis soft, jammy wine from a good vintage is medium bodied and not overly oaken, offering black cherry and vanilla in equal measure. On the finish is a note of pomegranate puree.\t\t88\t40\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tCosentino 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCosentino\n30342\tFrance\tA great swathe of red fruits gives this wine a full while fresh character.

The result gives an intense, concentrated character with crisp, tight lemon and pink grapefruit flavors. Still developing, the texture is mineral and nervy. The wine will benefit from a bit more time in the bottle so drink from 2016.\tEssentielle\t88\t12\tLoire Valley\tMuscadet S??vre et Maine\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDomaine des Tilleuls 2014 Essentielle  (Muscadet S??vre et Maine)\tMelon\tDomaine des Tilleuls\n30344\tFrance\tWith dusty white flower aromas, this is a perfumed wine with a tight texture and fruit. Still too young to drink, it does have a lively, fresh character that comes from the bright green fruits. As it softens, it will be better balanced, so drink from 2016.\t\t88\t23\tLoire Valley\tSancerre\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDomaine Jean-Pierre Vacher et Fils 2014  Sancerre\tSauvignon Blanc\tDomaine Jean-Pierre Vacher et Fils\n30345\tUS\tHalf Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Merlot along with just a smidgeon (6%) of Syrah, this wine provides aromas of smoke, plum, herbs and black currant.

Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tHedges Family Estate 2012 C.M.S. Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tRed Blend\tHedges Family Estate\n30346\tUS\tHigh-toned and 100% varietal, this ephemeral Pinot Gris was aged in stainless steel and is dry and waxy on the palate. Crisp green apple and lemon flavors are complemented by a mineral underbelly that makes this a food-friendly wine.\tHendry Vineyard\t88\t18\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tHendry 2014 Hendry Vineyard Pinot Gris (Napa Valley)\tPinot Gris\tHendry\n30597\tAustria\tWith the appetizing scent of lemon-spiked pear sorbet, it delivers breezy refreshment.

With echoing nuttiness and an apricot core, this does not fit any particular mold, but is intriguing, authentic and totally convincing.\tEdelschuh\t93\t45\tS?�dsteiermark\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?�MW\t@AnneInVino\tWohlmuth 2012 Edelschuh Sauvignon Blanc (S?�dsteiermark)\tSauvignon Blanc\tWohlmuth\n30599\tFrance\tDark, dense and packed with wood flavors, the wine is hard at this stage. But it is also laden with fruits to give a dramatically powerful potential for this second wine. Blackberry fruits go with the smoky flavors and promise a fresh view as the wine ages. Drink from 2017.\tPavillon Rouge de Margaux\t93\t\tBordeaux\tMargaux\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCh?�teau Margaux 2011 Pavillon Rouge de Margaux  (Margaux)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tCh?�teau Margaux\n30600\tFrance\tDark tannins dominate in this wine that has an austere side. The fruit under this dark structure is full of juicy black fruit flavors. The combination of the powerful texture and the ripe fruit has produced one of the best vintages from this chateau for many years. Drink from 2018.\t\t93\t\tBordeaux\tSaint-??milion\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCh?�teau Trottevieille 2011  Saint-??milion\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tCh?�teau Trottevieille\n30601\tAustria\tJust-ripe green pears and scented spring flowers make this a charming proposition. Underneath, a firm and concentrated body unfolds into a refreshing and long finish.\tWahre Werte Reserve\t92\t26\tKamptal\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?�MW\t@AnneInVino\tWeixelbaum 2012 Wahre Werte Reserve Gr?�ner Veltliner (Kamptal)\tGr?�ner Veltliner\tWeixelbaum\n30602\tAustria\tGolden and restrained, this wine does not give too much away on the nose. But the spicily soft palate delivers with a brilliant, lemon-zesty acidity well couched in mineral midpalate concentration with an enduring finish.\tHeiligenstein Reserve\t92\t\tKamptal\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?�MW\t@AnneInVino\tHiedler 2012 Heiligenstein Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)\tRiesling\tHiedler\n30603\tAustria\tJust faint touches of ripe, yellow pear appear on the nose, suggesting how tightly closed this wine still is. However, the generous palate is full of both green and yellow pears and injections of grapefruit acidity. Tight and long, it's best kept for a while. Drink as of 2016.\tThal Reserve\t92\t\tKamptal\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?�MW\t@AnneInVino\tHiedler 2012 Thal Reserve Gr?�ner Veltliner (Kamptal)\tGr?�ner Veltliner\tHiedler\n30604\tAustria\tClean-cut and zesty with the tang of grapefruit peel, a concentrated midpalate and a refreshing dryness, this Riesling shows elegance, power and lip-smacking lemon finish. Shy now, it will reveal more power with bottle age. Drink as of 2017.\tHeiligenstein Reserve\t92\t28\tKamptal\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?�MW\t@AnneInVino\tHirsch 2012 Heiligenstein Reserve Riesling (Kamptal)\tRiesling\tHirsch\n30605\tAustria\tSlender citrus zestiness is the theme here: is it bergamot or lime? The wonderfully rich core of phenolics provides heft and pith with a touch of white pepper here and there and a mossy savouriness that provides welcome refreshment.\t1000 Eimerberg Smaragd\t92\t\tWachau\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?�MW\t@AnneInVino\tLagler 2012 1000 Eimerberg Smaragd Neuburger (Wachau)\tNeuburger\tLagler\n30606\tChile\tSpiced cherry, plum and dry oak aromas drive the nose. The palate is plump, fruity and creamy feeling, with woody, resiny flavors of plum and raspberry. The finish is oaky and a bit hot, with mint and pepper notes.\tNimbus Single Vineyard\t88\t20\tCasablanca Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?�a Casablanca 2011 Nimbus Single Vineyard Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)\tPinot Noir\tVi?�a Casablanca\n30607\tFrance\tStructured and balanced, this wine has great fruits that go with the tannins and rich texture. There is an unusually low amount of Merlot (60%) with 25% Cabernet Sauvignon and 15% Cabernet Franc for the area, yet there is a strongly juicy feel to the wine that gives a generous side. It is developing well; drink from 2016.\t\t88\t18\tBordeaux\tFrancs C??tes de Bordeaux\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCh?�teau Godard Bellevue 2012  Francs C??tes de Bordeaux\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tCh?�teau Godard Bellevue\n30608\tFrance\tSpicy wood gives this wine a smooth character. It also adds lift, allowing the rich black fruits to speak out. Acidity is well integrated into the tannins and balanced character of the wine. It's one of seven Bordeaux properties in the Yung family since 1962. Drink from 2016.\t\t88\t20\tBordeaux\tCadillac C??tes de Bordeaux\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCh?�teau les Hauts de Palette 2012  Cadillac C??tes de Bordeaux\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tCh?�teau les Hauts de Palette\n30609\tFrance\tThe wine is all fruit initially and then the firmer tannins kick in. It has a strongly tannic core that leaves the wine dry and tough after 12 months in barrel. The fruit weight should broaden the wine out, giving black fruitiness in the future. Drink from 2017.\t\t88\t17\tBordeaux\tCastillon C??tes de Bordeaux\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCh?�teau Roquevieille 2012  Castillon C??tes de Bordeaux\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tCh?�teau Roquevieille\n30610\tUS\tThe Black Eyed Peas' singer Fergie and renowned winemaker Joey Tensley present an in-your-face Viognier, deeply yellow, nearing brown in color, with aromas of dried apricot, honey-roasted nuts and smoky mezcal with lime. Lush flavors of burnt orange peel, smoke and Scotch whisky make for an intriguing drink, certainly not for those seeking a dainty white wine.\t\t88\t28\tCalifornia\tSanta Ynez Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tFerguson Crest 2010 Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley)\tViognier\tFerguson Crest\n30611\tUS\tLight in oak and mid-weight all in all, this Chardonnay from a cooler sub-section of the Napa Valley is replete with baked apple veering into dried fruit character and a touch of vanilla.\tBlondie Gone Wild Red Hen Vineyard\t88\t33\tCalifornia\tOak Knoll District\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tIdeology 2012 Blondie Gone Wild Red Hen Vineyard Chardonnay (Oak Knoll District)\tChardonnay\tIdeology\n30612\tUS\tGrenache's essential fruity character is well-preserved thanks to the use of a whole berry press. Popcorn pink in color, it offers sweetly peachy flavors adorned by wild strawberry and tangerine. The wine light and minerally.\tPauline's Vineyard Ros??\t88\t24\tCalifornia\tDry Creek Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tKokomo 2013 Pauline's Vineyard Ros?? Grenache (Dry Creek Valley)\tGrenache\tKokomo\n29846\tItaly\tDark spice, camphor, menthol and crushed herb aromas take center stage in this wine. The palate offers dried black cherry, mocha and licorice flavors alongside assertive, close-grained tannins. A hint of candied orange zest signals the close.\tAutinbej\t88\t37\tPiedmont\tBarbaresco\t\tKerin O�??Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tCa' del Baio 2014 Autinbej  (Barbaresco)\tNebbiolo\tCa' del Baio\n29847\tItaly\tThis leads with violet, black-skinned berry and baking spice aromas while red cherry, raspberry and white pepper flavors mark the savory palate.

It's dry, with significant tannins and crisp acidity framing rich, complex cherry, red currant, mocha and buttered cinnamon toast flavors. Versatile across a huge range of foods, a great house wine.

The nose brings toast, heat and potency, while the flavors are saturated, spicy and revolve around wild berry, tea, spice, caramel and savory warmth. Only gets better as it opens and airs; drink now through 2012.\tAlazan CJ's Barrel\t90\t32\tCasablanca Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tKingston Family 2008 Alazan CJ's Barrel Pinot Noir (Casablanca Valley)\tPinot Noir\tKingston Family\n3959\tChile\tOpens with heavy aromas of raisin, prune, leather and chocolate. The palate is just racy enough, with depth, big tannins and structure. Tastes grapy and big, with blackberry fruit and a chocolaty aftertaste. Toasty and a little gritty and tannic on the finish, and ultimately it's a little sweet but still impressive for Chilean Syrah.\tCuv??e Alexandre Las Kuras Vineyard\t90\t24\tCachapoal Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLapostolle 2007 Cuv??e Alexandre Las Kuras Vineyard Syrah (Cachapoal Valley)\tSyrah\tLapostolle\n3960\tUS\tThe latest version of this popular blend drops the Chardonnay and adds 11% Gr?�ner Veltliner to the Roussanne-Viognier blend. It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish.\tSubduction White\t90\t18\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tSyncline 2009 Subduction White White (Columbia Valley (WA))\tWhite Blend\tSyncline\n3961\tArgentina\tRound, thick and pulsing, but not too hard, angular or tannic.

It doesn't show the voluptuous approachability of the 2005 or the 2007, which will be released next year. It's fairly acidic and tannic. But there's a luscious core of blackberries and black currants. Try after 2012; it might be a very long-lived wine.\t\t90\t195\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tM by Michael Mondavi 2006 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tM by Michael Mondavi\n3966\tUS\tA Ch?�teauneuf-du-Pape-style Rh??ne blend that really nails it for satisfaction.

A smooth texture and well-integrated tannins make for a long and complex finish.\t\t89\t32\tVirginia\tMonticello\t\tCarrie Dykes\t\tStinson 2014 Meritage (Monticello)\tMeritage\tStinson\n129423\tPortugal\tThis crisp, clean and ripe wine is finely balanced. The toastiness from wood aging in new barrels is balanced with the rich citrus and sliced apple and a tight, mineral character. This is a full-bodied wine needing a few more months to age. Drink from 2018.\tAguia Moura em Vinhas Velhas Reserva\t89\t18\tDouro\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tWines & Winemakers 2016 Aguia Moura em Vinhas Velhas Reserva White (Douro)\tPortuguese White\tWines & Winemakers\n129424\tUruguay\tAn opaque color is appropriate for this fully extracted Tannat. Aromas of blackberry, sandalwood and exotic spices are a strong point, while the palate is primed with grating acidity. Full blackberry, cassis and herbal flavors finish cool and toasty but long due to the wine's full-force acidity.\tDomaine Castelar Vineyard\t89\t40\tCanelones\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFamilia Deicas 2015 Domaine Castelar Vineyard Tannat (Canelones)\tTannat\tFamilia Deicas\n129425\tItaly\tA blend of organically cultivated Corvina, Rondinella and Corvinone, this has enticing aromas of red berry and fragrant blue flower.

It has beautiful, soft, fruit and floral aromas, luxurious and soothing berry and black-currant flavors and a layered texture that seems to melt in the mouth. It's full bodied, braced by fine-grained tannins, and seems to unfold nuance after nuance with each sip before lingering nicely on the finish.\tLodi Native Marian's Vineyard\t93\t35\tCalifornia\tMokelumne River\tCentral Valley\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tSt. Amant 2014 Lodi Native Marian's Vineyard Zinfandel (Mokelumne River)\tZinfandel\tSt. Amant\n129665\tFrance\tThis will be a delicious, ripe and full wine.

As befits a wine from Nuits Saint-Georges, it is dark with tannins as well as fruit. It has a good structure, with dense blackberry and plum flavors that are developing. Give this wine until 2022.\tLes Damodes Premier Cru\t93\t101\tBurgundy\tNuits-St.-Georges\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tJean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2014 Les Damodes Premier Cru  (Nuits-St.-Georges)\tPinot Noir\tJean-Luc and Paul Aegerter\n129669\tUS\tThis producer impresses again with this vibrantly layered, fleshy coastal-grown white, which is golden in color and brooding in baked lemon and a length of spiced apple.

It has dark tannins that still give dryness at the heart of the wine. Alongside that are the beautiful black fruits, dense structure and balanced acidity. The wine will be better from 2018 as the tannins soften further.\tDona Georgina\t93\t60\tD?�o\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tQuinta de Lemos 2010 Dona Georgina Red (D?�o)\tPortuguese Red\tQuinta de Lemos\n129672\tGermany\tMore delicate in character than the Kiedrich Turmberg, this gossamer-light auslese balances slick honey, peach and yellow-cherry flavors against a backdrop of crystalline minerality.

Iijima\t\tRobert Weil 2014 Kiedrich Gr??fenberg Auslese Riesling (Rheingau)\tRiesling\tRobert Weil\n129673\tArgentina\tThis is a top-dog Malbec from start to finish. Aromas of cassis, black plum and blackberry are well oaked and in harmony with each other. While this is tannic, rubbery and hard in feel, the wine's lusty plum, raisin, chocolate and herbal flavors can handle it. A spicy, toasty, chocolaty finish is fully oaked and strapping. Drink through 2023.\tPr1mum\t93\t65\tMendoza Province\tUco Valley\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSalentein 2013 Pr1mum Malbec (Uco Valley)\tMalbec\tSalentein\n129674\tUS\tThis biodynamically farmed vineyard is often found as a named designate, and for good reason. It's one of the Willamette Valley's most distinctive and evocative sites, with less of an emphasis on pure fruit flavors, and more attention to details such as herbal tea, earth, stone and dried leaf. The fruit is tart and lightly herbal, like a fresh-picked mountain berry.\tMomtazi Vineyard\t93\t36\tOregon\tMcMinnville\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tSt. Innocent 2014 Momtazi Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville)\tPinot Noir\tSt. Innocent\n129675\tItaly\tAromas of underbrush, leather, mature berry, grilled herb and fragrant blue flower lead the nose.

Vibrantly fresh and floral, it's sharpened by a razor's edge of minerality that lingers through the finish. It's gorgeous now for its ebullience and youth but should improve well into the 2020's.\tSchloss Reichartshausen Sp??tlese\t93\t35\tRheingau\t\t\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tBalthasar Ress 2015 Schloss Reichartshausen Sp??tlese Riesling (Rheingau)\tRiesling\tBalthasar Ress\n129677\tArgentina\tThis Malbec is exceedingly ripe from start to finish. Aromas of blackberry, raisin, char and loamy earth announce a 16% heavyweight that holds onto its elegance. Flush, plump and elastic on the palate, this tastes of fig, blackberry, cassis and mocha. Chocolate and woodspice flavors drive a lush, dense finish that's a touch hot. Drink through 2020.\tR\t93\t65\tMendoza Province\tMendoza\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodega Renacer 2012 R Malbec (Mendoza)\tMalbec\tBodega Renacer\n129919\tUS\tThis ripe, rich, almost decadently thick wine is about as close as a Washington vintner can come to the decadently ripe style of the cultish Bordeaux blends of California. Along with the unctuous New World fruit, sap and flesh, there are thick, ripe tannins and a vivid acid underpinning. It drinks well right out of the bottle, the flavors beautifully wrapped together, mixing black fruits, black olives, herb and earth, smoke and coffee and toast.\tReserve\t91\t105\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tNicholas Cole Cellars 2004 Reserve Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\tRed Blend\tNicholas Cole Cellars\n129920\tUS\tShows the clean, citrus acid juiciness and silky texture of the appellation and is totally dry. But you'll find ripe cherry, currant, pomegranate, peppermint tea, mineral and smoky oak flavors that finish complex and satisfying.

Rita Hills)\tPinot Noir\tPali\n129921\tArgentina\tThere is a select group of under-$20 Malbecs from Argentina that really do the country and the variety proud. Santos is one of them; the 2006 is easy and ripe on the nose, with lovely cola, berry and herb aromas. The palate has a natural feel and bright black-fruit flavors. Not overly complex but a winner for the next year or two.\tLa Madras Vineyard\t91\t18\tMendoza Province\tMendoza\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRicardo Santos 2006 La Madras Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza)\tMalbec\tRicardo Santos\n129922\tAustria\tHerbs, spices and green fruit aromas show the freshness of this wine. On the palate, tropical fruits, apricots and lychees also appear, fleshing out a superb Sauvignon Blanc. With its edges of apple skin tannins, it could age for 2�??3 years, but it already has huge concentration and elegance. Glass stopper.\tKranachberg\t91\t48\tS?�dsteiermark\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tSattlerhof 2006 Kranachberg Sauvignon Blanc (S?�dsteiermark)\tSauvignon Blanc\tSattlerhof\n129923\tGermany\tThick, oily and sweet, this wine is clearly not a typical sp??tlese.

It's not super oaky as only half the wine sees new barrels, but you can definitely taste some wood. Will drink best in 2009�??2010.\tB Crux\t91\t24\tMendoza Province\tUco Valley\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tO. Fournier 2005 B Crux Red (Uco Valley)\tRed Blend\tO. Fournier\n129926\tUS\tThis pure Syrah from Reininger's estate vineyard has the focus and also the tightness that often characterize single-vineyard wines. There are dense flavors of cranberry and pomegranate, plenty of natural acid, along with polished tannins and a soothing layer of toasty oak, that helps smooth the rough edges and buff up the finish. Hints of earth, leaf and tar add detail and interest all the way through a lingering finish.\tAsh Hollow Vineyard\t91\t41\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tReininger 2005 Ash Hollow Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\tSyrah\tReininger\n129927\tUS\tIt's 100% Cabernet Franc, a delightful, bright and forward wine with sweet boysenberry and blueberry fruit. Behind the bright, luscious fruit flavors are chewy, earthy tannins. They are ripe and dry and give the wine weight and authority. It's a complete wine�??from the floral violet/rose petal aromas to the ripe berry fruit to the substantial tannins.

The palate is surprisingly high in acidity and choppy, but lumbering oak adds some heft to the berry fruit and cola flavors that lead the charge. A bit smacking and medicinal, and herbal to boot.\tGran Reserva\t84\t17\tMaipo Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVistamar 2006 Gran Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah (Maipo Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Syrah\tVistamar\n73283\tChile\tThere's a lot of individuality to this wine, just not all good. The nose has cigar box and over-the-top sweet and baked aromas, yet the palate has a grating, acidic feel but also spice and raisiny flavors. All of it makes you more confused than confident; it has its good traits but seems out of whack.\tDuette\t84\t20\tMaipo Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tIndomita 2008 Duette Cabernet Sauvignon-Carmen??re (Maipo Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Carmen??re\tIndomita\n73284\tUS\tThe hot climate in which the grapes were grown shows in this wine's extreme softness and jammy ripeness.

This is very appetizing and cries out for soft cheeses.\tL'Aplomb\t90\t20\tAlsace\tAlsace\t\tAnne Krebiehl?�MW\t@AnneInVino\tDomaine Riefl??-Landmann 2014 L'Aplomb White (Alsace)\tWhite Blend\tDomaine Riefl??-Landmann\n63262\tFrance\tOn the basis that anything goes with ros??, this wine is 100-percent Sangiovese, known locally as Niellucciu. The acidity that is typical of the grape is very present as are red cherry and tight fruit flavors. It is so crisp and lively, bouncing from the glass and leaving a beautiful array of red fruits at the end.\tPauline\t90\t16\tFrance Other\tMediterran??e\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDomaine Terre de Mistral 2015 Pauline Ros??

It smells like wild berries and light baking spices, tastes almost jammy, and has a classy dry balance. A very smooth texture wraps up all that goodness and makes it easy to enjoy.\tSkyland Ridge\t89\t10\tCalifornia\tAmador County\tSierra Foothills\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tMontevina 2013 Skyland Ridge Barbera (Amador County)\tBarbera\tMontevina\n63266\tItaly\tThis opens with earthy aromas of brimstone, scorched soil, hay, orchard fruit and dried herb.

The complexity is compelling, and the length impressive, though it fades just a little too much to stand up to long term aging.\t\t89\t28\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tBoedecker Cellars 2013 Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)\tChardonnay\tBoedecker Cellars\n63268\tItaly\tHere's a delicately scented wine that offers aromas suggesting mature orchard fruit, botanical herb and wild flower.

The flavors are deep and impressive, ranging from cassis to chocolate. Oak provides smoke and spice. It has that brilliant, velvety texture you expect from wines of this caliber, but, like so many such bottlings, it lacks the acidity to provide backbone.\tReserve\t91\t60\tCalifornia\tSonoma Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tArtesa 1997 Reserve Merlot (Sonoma Valley)\tMerlot\tArtesa\n62511\tUS\tSometimes a young Pinot is deceptive. This wine is young and silky, supple and fruity and has some sharp acidity, but it doesn't overwhelm. It's the kind of wine that doesn't overshadow food. But it's excellent Pinot. The depth of flavor and long finish suggest aging possibilities, but there's no reason not to drink and enjoy it now.\tMills Vineyard\t91\t55\tCalifornia\tMount Harlan\tCentral Coast\t\t\tCalera 1997 Mills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mount Harlan)\tPinot Noir\tCalera\n62512\tNew Zealand\tFull of butter notes, along with toasted oatmeal and Brazil nuts, this rich, oily Chard is all about New World power, yet allied to an Old World sense of balance.

Smoke, ash and bacon fat notes appear on both the nose and the palate, as does a hint of green herb. Is, as always, an ode to ripe, juicy blackberries.\tThe Marauder\t91\t75\tCalifornia\tCalifornia\tCalifornia Other\t\t\tSine Qua Non 1999 The Marauder Syrah (California)\tSyrah\tSine Qua Non\n62514\tUS\tGood Zins from this appellation are not common, which is too bad, considering how fine this one is. The fully ripened berry and spice fruit is married to intricate, lacy tannins, and the wine is dry. Despite the big flavors, it has an airy, feathery quality, anchored in crisp acidity.\t\t91\t36\tCalifornia\tSanta Cruz Mountains\tCentral Coast\t\t\tSavannah-Chanelle 1999 Zinfandel (Santa Cruz Mountains)\tZinfandel\tSavannah-Chanelle\n62515\tAustralia\tToasty, mealy aromas combine with peach and smoke in a beguiling, complex nose that resembles a fine Chassagne-Montrachet. Flavors of peach and citrus coat the palate without ever seeming overly rich, heavy or oily, extending through the long ripe-citrus finish.\tPicadilly\t91\t31\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGrosset 2000 Picadilly Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tGrosset\n62516\tUS\tComplex and intriguing in the nose, the wine is weighty on the palate and shows a fine blend of citrus, herb, melon, toast, pear and spice flavors.

The wine is definitely New World in style with its creamy wood flavors, yet it also has the ability to age, which is more Burgundian in character.\tBarrel Fermented\t91\t23\tStellenbosch\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tMulderbosch 1999 Barrel Fermented Chardonnay (Stellenbosch)\tChardonnay\tMulderbosch\n62518\tUS\tThis is the real stuff, with pepper, blackberry, smoke and an earthy note.

With this wine, Flora Springs raises the bar. It has all the fruity flavors you expect from the vintage, with the architecture of a fine Napa red. The tannins and acids are softly intricate. Mainly Sangiovese and Merlot, with a dollop of Cabernet Sauvignon.\tPoggio del Papa\t91\t35\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tFlora Springs 1999 Poggio del Papa Sangiovese (Napa Valley)\tSangiovese\tFlora Springs\n62520\tUS\tZesty aromas of bramble and alpine strawberry are laid across an underlying chalkiness and graphite minerality, making for an inviting yet well-structured nose on this Grenache-based pink wine. Ripe strawberry and hibiscus notes show first on the palate, which rides a tense, chalky line, presenting flavors that are persistent but not overpowering.\t\t90\t30\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tDubost 2015 Ros??

The berry/cherry fruit is nicely adorned with toasty barrel flavors, and it's as satiny as new sheets.

The wine coaxes silky-smooth, leathery tannins into a sinewy texture bounded by meat, cigar and decadent amounts of white pepper. Complex and layered, it'll sit well in the cellar, through 2023.\tLedbetter Family Vineyard\t91\t49\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tLongboard 2013 Ledbetter Family Vineyard Syrah (Russian River Valley)\tSyrah\tLongboard\n62765\tIsrael\tInky red violet in the glass, this wine features aromas of raspberry, vanilla and violet.

In this ode to generations gone by, the grower and winemaker find common ground in showcasing a big-bodied, black-purple expression of fig, plum and grippy leather that lands softly on the palate.\tPagani Ranch\t90\t36\tCalifornia\tSonoma Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tCarlisle 2013 Pagani Ranch Alicante Bouschet (Sonoma Valley)\tAlicante Bouschet\tCarlisle\n61180\tUS\tThe nose on this creative blend of 52% Gew?�rztraminer, 25% Sauvignon Blanc and 23% Chenin Blanc is quite showy with peach, baked orange, apple blossom and honeysuckle notes. But the real star is the palate that is racy with sizzling energy and flavors of cut grass, lemongrass and sour-apple peels.\tTrois Fleurs\t90\t20\tCalifornia\tSanta Ynez Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tCarlson 2014 Trois Fleurs White (Santa Ynez Valley)\tWhite Blend\tCarlson\n61181\tBulgaria\tBlack cherry, red raspberry, dried violets and graphite scent this Thracian Valley Syrah.

On the palate is raspberry fruit, a hint of veggies and some tight tannins. The finish is lean, and here those tannins assert themselves again in a way that's more than the fruit calls for. Still, it's pretty solid Cab. Best Buy.\t\t86\t8\tMaipo Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa Julia 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCasa Julia\n60396\tItaly\tA soft, creamy wine, with crispness on the palate.

Hofstatter\n60397\tUS\tCertainly denser and richer than the regular bottling. Still, it is not a lot to get excited about. Berry-cherry flavors are well-oaked and framed in silky tannins. Feels easy and slippery in the mouth, but lacks the depth you want, especially at this price.\tReserve\t86\t50\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\t\t\tSaintsbury 1999 Reserve Pinot Noir (Carneros)\tPinot Noir\tSaintsbury\n60398\tItaly\tThis wine from the shores of Lake Garda has fresh, attractively crisp fruit, and a touch of acidity over some broad, food-friendly fruit.\tSan Benedetto\t86\t\tLombardy\tLugana\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tZenato 2002 San Benedetto  (Lugana)\tWhite Blend\tZenato\n60399\tItaly\tA 100% single-vineyard Garganega from the home vineyards of Zonin, this has ripe, soft almond-flavored fruit with touches of vanilla and citrus.\tPodere il Giangio\t86\t\tVeneto\tGambellara Classico\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tZonin 2002 Podere il Giangio  (Gambellara Classico)\tGarganega\tZonin\n60400\tUS\tSimple and jammy, although tasty enough, with lip-smacking, candied flavors of cherries, raspberries and spicy mocha.

The finish is long, clean and fresh, and the mouthfeel is good and lean, and overall quite crisp. Standard fare, but a good example of Chardonnay.\tSanta Digna\t86\t10\tCuric?? Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMiguel Torres 2002 Santa Digna Chardonnay (Curic?? Valley)\tChardonnay\tMiguel Torres\n60402\tChile\tMint and licorice aromas combine to give a medicinal impression that fortunately is not confirmed on the palate. In the mouth, it's ripe and mostly fresh, with flavors of plum, cassis and blackberry. The finish is round and smooth, with more mint. Solid and racy if not overly stylish.\tVitisterra Grand Reserve\t86\t15\tMaipo Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMorand?? 2001 Vitisterra Grand Reserve Syrah (Maipo Valley)\tSyrah\tMorand??\n60403\tItaly\tPiccini's nod to the '90s (the other wines are fairly traditional) is this internationally styled �??mini Tuscan�?? that blends ripe plum fruit with the chocolate and vanilla flavors imparted by oak.\tPatriale\t86\t10\tTuscany\tToscana\t\t\t\tPiccini 1999 Patriale Sangiovese (Toscana)\tSangiovese\tPiccini\n60404\tUS\tA charming wine with lots of Pinot character. Flavors range from cherries and berries to rose, tobacco, coffee and peppery spice. A little on the thin side, it's very light and soft in the mouth, and is not built for age. But it's fun and enjoyable now.\tReserve Olivet\t86\t30\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tKenwood 2000 Reserve Olivet Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tKenwood\n60405\tItaly\tToasty, buttery and spicy, this blend's aromas and flavors are heavily influenced by barrique. So if you are oak-averse, be warned. The lavish wood is adequately supported by a wine that has good weight and density but doesn't contribute much additional flavor.\tCapo Martino in Ruttaris\t86\t48\tNortheastern Italy\tVenezia Giulia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJermann 2000 Capo Martino in Ruttaris White (Venezia Giulia)\tWhite Blend\tJermann\n60406\tChile\tThis is a clean, lightweight wine with gripping yet silky tannins. The nose of hickory smoke is wrapped in loam, which repeats on the palate with smoky cherry and fresh green herbs. On the finish, the semisweet herbal quality is a treat.\tConcepcion Reserva\t86\t11\tMaule Valley\t\t\t\t\tFrancisco Gillmore 1998 Concepcion Reserva Cabernet Sauvignon (Maule Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tFrancisco Gillmore\n60407\tItaly\tClean, crisp and fresh, which is enough to satisfy most Pinot Grigio drinkers.

So why the modest score on the winery's top white? One simple word: oak. With this wine's buttery, oaky aromas and flavors of peach, cinnamon and brown sugar, it could pass for a decent Chardonnay. But this blend of Tocai Friulano, Pinot Bianco and Sauvignon Blanc from a great producer should do so much more.\tTerre Alte - Rosazzo Bianco\t86\t41\tNortheastern Italy\tColli Orientali del Friuli\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLivio Felluga 2000 Terre Alte - Rosazzo Bianco White (Colli Orientali del Friuli)\tWhite Blend\tLivio Felluga\n60409\tUS\tMade in a Super-Tuscan style, this includes 12% Syrah and 5% Malbec. Young, tight and still a bit severe, it needs airing out. But the fruit has the right structure for Sangiovese which, though rare, does quite well in Washington. Tart and spicy, with cranberry and strawberry fruit flavors under a warm blanket of oak and acid.\t\t88\t24\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tWalla Walla Vintners 2006 Sangiovese (Columbia Valley (WA))\tSangiovese\tWalla Walla Vintners\n60410\tUS\tGood, rich Napa Cabernet in this bottle, packed with blackberry, currant, licorice and cedar flavors.

Longoria's '06 is a prime example of this precocity, showing a soft, melted mouthfeel and flavors of cherries, smoky vanilla, Asian spicebox and Proven??al herbs. At its flashy, impertinent best now.\tRancho Santa Rosa\t88\t45\tCalifornia\tSta. Rita Hills\tCentral Coast\t\t\tLongoria 2006 Rancho Santa Rosa Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)\tPinot Noir\tLongoria\n60647\tAustria\tInviting hints of crushed blueberry and blackberry show the slightest overtones of smoke. The palate is smooth, with still slightly crunchy but ripe tannins that provide a pleasant framework for the refreshing berry fruit.

This blend of Cabernet Franc (80%) and Mourv??dre is pale peach in color and offers notes of herb, cereal and strawberry.

But once it hits the palate the wine shines with intense black fruit, sugar beet and chocolate flavors. The finish is toasty and warm, with saturation and texture. Almost over the edge as far as ripeness, but not quite. Drink now through 2012.\tVendimia Seleccionada\t91\t59\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGarc??a Figuero 2005 Vendimia Seleccionada  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tGarc??a Figuero\n60926\tUS\tThis soft and seductive wine is reminiscent of a good Chassagne-Montrachet from a relatively warm year. It has the same ripe, lightly tropical fruit, inflected with citrus and buoyed by firm acidity. The use of oak is restrained, the balance perfect, and the finish long and satisfying.\tCuv??e For?�ts Diverses\t91\t35\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tHamacher 2007 Cuv??e For?�ts Diverses Chardonnay (Willamette Valley)\tChardonnay\tHamacher\n60927\tUS\tPowerful scents mix dried herb, wet grass and petrol�??it could be mistaken for Sauvignon Blanc in a blind tasting, and it has that much density and extract.

As expected, the fruit is exuberant and lush with hints of tinned apricots and peach jam. An underlying note of lemon zest enlivens the palate and carries over to the long, flowery finish. There's lots of sweetness here; consider serving on its own.\tHallgartener Jongfer Sp??tlese Goldkap\t91\t43\tRheingau\t\t\t\t\tPrinz 2008 Hallgartener Jongfer Sp??tlese Goldkap Riesling (Rheingau)\tRiesling\tPrinz\n60932\tNew Zealand\tThe best of this year's crop of Saint Clair Pinots is the Pioneer Block 4, which boasts dark and mysterious aromas of damp earth and ripe plums.

There's plenty of tart, tangy cherry fruit also, though it seems to hit a wall, perhaps due to the recent bottling. This is a wine that could score even higher with additional bottle age.\tMeredith Mitchell Vineyard\t91\t50\tOregon\tMcMinnville\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tKen Wright 2008 Meredith Mitchell Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville)\tPinot Noir\tKen Wright\n60935\tUS\tThis is a delight�??a supple, polished, ripe and full-throttle Pinot Noir offered at a mid-1990s price. Winemaker Aron Hess keeps the alcohol at 13.5%, the oak a moderate 20% new, and the earthy underpinnings gracefully in check. Lush purple and blue fruits are lightly licked with chocolate; the result is a very satisfying mouthful of wine.\tLia's Vineyard\t91\t24\tOregon\tChehalem Mountains\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tLongplay 2008 Lia's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Chehalem Mountains)\tPinot Noir\tLongplay\n60936\tGermany\tAn expressive, extroverted style that still communicates a sense of place.

Along with the unctuous New World fruit, sap and flesh, there are thick, ripe tannins and a vivid acid underpinning. It drinks well right out of the bottle, the flavors beautifully wrapped together, mixing black fruits, black olives, herb and earth, smoke and coffee and toast.\tReserve\t91\t105\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tNicholas Cole Cellars 2004 Reserve Red (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\tRed Blend\tNicholas Cole Cellars\tGT_90_Points\n129920\tUS\tShows the clean, citrus acid juiciness and silky texture of the appellation and is totally dry.

Not overly complex but a winner for the next year or two.\tLa Madras Vineyard\t91\t18\tMendoza Province\tMendoza\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRicardo Santos 2006 La Madras Vineyard Malbec (Mendoza)\tMalbec\tRicardo Santos\tGT_90_Points\n129922\tAustria\tHerbs, spices and green fruit aromas show the freshness of this wine. On the palate, tropical fruits, apricots and lychees also appear, fleshing out a superb Sauvignon Blanc.

There are dense flavors of cranberry and pomegranate, plenty of natural acid, along with polished tannins and a soothing layer of toasty oak, that helps smooth the rough edges and buff up the finish. Hints of earth, leaf and tar add detail and interest all the way through a lingering finish.\tAsh Hollow Vineyard\t91\t41\tWashington\tWalla Walla Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tReininger 2005 Ash Hollow Vineyard Syrah (Walla Walla Valley (WA))\tSyrah\tReininger\tGT_90_Points\n129927\tUS\tIt's 100% Cabernet Franc, a delightful, bright and forward wine with sweet boysenberry and blueberry fruit. Behind the bright, luscious fruit flavors are chewy, earthy tannins. They are ripe and dry and give the wine weight and authority.

The wine displays a great deal of finesse, and the mouthfeel is velvety and rich, with dried cherry and anise flavors that extend through the spicy, long and even finish. A very impressive red with some tannins to lose, this is one Minervois that's capable�??and worthy�??of aging.\tCumulo Nimbus\t91\t35\tLanguedoc-Roussillon\tMinervois\t\t\t\tAbbotts 1998 Cumulo Nimbus Shiraz (Minervois)\tShiraz\tAbbotts\tGT_90_Points\n30597\tAustria\tWith the appetizing scent of lemon-spiked pear sorbet, it delivers breezy refreshment.

The nose on this bottling is delicate but with tons of sexy, supple depth, mixing red cherry, hibiscus and pomegranate with iron and sweet bay leaf. Perfect red fruits decorate the lavish palate: the tartness of cranberry, the lushness of red cherry, the brightness of pomegranate, all cut by eucalyptus and expert acidity.\tDierberg Vineyard\t94\t46\tCalifornia\tSanta Maria Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tFlying Goat Cellars 2012 Dierberg Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)\tPinot Noir\tFlying Goat Cellars\tGT_90_Points\n91858\tUS\tRich with iron and carpaccio notes on the nose, this single vineyard expression also shows dried rose petals, leather, red cherry, turned loam, dense black sand and exotic red spice.

Ynez Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tRideau 2013 Estate Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley)\tViognier\tRideau\tLT_90_Points\tRestrained yet ripe peach and nectarine aromas show themselves slowly in a very demure manner on this wine. The palate is more about sensation than flavors, with bitter-sour elements and a bit of grit more prominent than the nectarine flesh and green apple flavors.\n40380\tFrance\tCaradeux Premier Cru\t91\t45\tBurgundy\tPernand-Vergelesses\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tLouis Latour 2011 Caradeux Premier Cru  (Pernand-Vergelesses)\tChardonnay\tLouis Latour\tGT_90_Points\tWhile this wine demonstrates the telltale cool element of the appellation, it also offers ripe fruit, pear and peach flavors lightly layered with wood. The wine is crisp at the end, with a mineral aftertaste. Drink from 2016.\n48182\tUS\tReserve\t90\t60\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tEn Garde 2010 Reserve Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tEn Garde\tGT_90_Points\tWith a concentrated bouquet of black cherry and leathery earth, this straddles the richness of California fruit with an Old World layering of savory sumptuousness. Built with structure and subtle acidity, it is meant to be enjoyed at the table, a pork tenderloin or mushroom quiche among the pairing possibilities.\n13412\tUS\t\t86\t20\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tGordon Brothers 2008 Merlot (Columbia Valley (WA))\tMerlot\tGordon Brothers\tLT_90_Points\tA young wine from a high-acid year, and it's showing a fair amount of earth and green, herbal flavor. The fruit seems just on the edge of ripe, with hints of brambly berry. Well balanced in a tough year.\n90578\tPortugal\tCastello d'Alba Limited Edition\t93\t30\tDouro\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tRui Roboredo Madeira 2012 Castello d'Alba Limited Edition Red (Douro)\tPortuguese Red\tRui Roboredo Madeira\tGT_90_Points\tThe rich fruit and tannins are immensely dense and concentrated. Black plums and the darkest structure give promise for long-term aging. Produced from a field blend of old vines, this is an impressive wine that speaks strongly of the schist soil and ripe grapes. Drink from 2020.\n3455\tUS\tEstate Grown\t88\t19\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tBalletto 2015 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Russian River Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tBalletto\tLT_90_Points\tFrom a relatively cool site for the variety, this white shows an abundance of green olive and Meyer lemon. Moderate body and acidity allow for a touch of lemongrass spiciness and black licorice amid the textured mouthfeel and length.\n11795\tItaly\t\t87\t\tTuscany\tMaremma Toscana\t\tKerin O�??Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tMirus 2011  Maremma Toscana\tRed Blend\tMirus\tLT_90_Points\tRed berry, baking spice and scorched earth aromas waft from the glass of this straightforward red. The easygoing palate offers red berry, cinnamon and a gamey note alongside smooth but rather fleeting tannins. It's at its ideal drinking window so drink now.\n4004\tFrance\tTerre Promise\t88\t20\tProvence\tC??tes de Provence Sainte-Victoire\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCh?�teau Henri Bonnaud 2013 Terre Promise Ros?? (C??tes de Provence Sainte-Victoire)\tRos??\tCh?�teau Henri Bonnaud\tLT_90_Points\tA fruity wine, it shows ripe red berries, red currants and refreshing acidity. So while the wine has weight, it is also totally fresh and crisp. It's a ros?? for food, rich while balanced.\n18077\tChile\tGran Reserva Etiqueta Negra\t90\t30\tMaipo Valley\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?�a Tarapac?� 2013 Gran Reserva Etiqueta Negra Cabernet Sauvignon (Maipo Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tVi?�a Tarapac?�\tGT_90_Points\tStalky, gritty aromas of olive, eucalyptus and berry fruits are 100% Chilean. This feels big, wide and tannic. Flavors of roasted berry fruits are stalky and herbal, while this finishes with peppery, herbal overtones and gritty, chewy tannins. Drink through 2021.\n2454\tUS\tCopeland Vineyard\t90\t25\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tTwo Mountain 2012 Copeland Vineyard Syrah (Yakima Valley)\tSyrah\tTwo Mountain\tGT_90_Points\tYou'd swear this 100% varietal wine had some Viognier in it, but the orange-peel aromas and flavors are just a hallmark of Yakima Valley fruit. It also features abundant cranberry, mulberry, rose hip and savory notes. The supple feel with light meat accents is where this wine really shines, showing purity, texture and a lot of elegance. Those looking for big fruit, look elsewhere.\n89540\tUS\tHeritage Cuvee\t84\t12\tCalifornia\tCentral Coast\tCentral Coast\t\t\tCurtis 1999 Heritage Cuvee Red (Central Coast)\tRh??ne-style Red Blend\tCurtis\tLT_90_Points\tSmells rustic, with dried herb aromas, like sage and oregano although there are some pretty blueberry and black cherry flavors. There's also a tart, acidic streak that persists into the finish, and it's very dry. A Rh??ne-style blend of Syrah, Grenache, Mourv??dre and Counoise. �??S.H.\n37067\tSpain\tCrianza\t88\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRam??n Bilbao 2006 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tRam??n Bilbao\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a smooth, subdued style of Rioja that's perfect for tapas or casual consumption. The nose offers the right kind of entry: cherry and raspberry with dusty spice. And the flavors are friendly and suggest black fruits and smoke. A little more oaky and charred than some, but a nice crianza nonetheless.\n115016\tUS\tR\t87\t28\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tDiStefano 2008 R Syrah (Columbia Valley (WA))\tSyrah\tDiStefano\tLT_90_Points\tQuite dry on the palate, this seems less ripe than the previous vintage. The opening flavors are dominated by earth and stem�??rather than fruit�??followed by notes of baking spice, coconut and caramel.\n17298\tFrance\tGrenouilles Grand Cru\t94\t70\tBurgundy\tChablis\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tDomaine Jean-Paul et Beno??t Droin 2010 Grenouilles Grand Cru  (Chablis)\tChardonnay\tDomaine Jean-Paul et Beno??t Droin\tGT_90_Points\tFirm and closed, this shows both richness and minerality. It has hidden power, concentration and a steely edge. It's crisp and densely packed with minerality and ripeness. For aging over at least seven years.\n55404\tUS\tSilvaspoons Vineyard\t87\t23\tCalifornia\tLodi\tCentral Valley\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tFenestra 2009 Silvaspoons Vineyard Tempranillo (Lodi)\tTempranillo\tFenestra\tLT_90_Points\tLivermore-based Fenestra always does well by Silvaspoons VIneyard in Lodi, a site devoted to Iberian and other unusual varieties, and its Tempranillo is bright and full-bodied, a glass of chewy dark cherries and coffee and caramel. Black in color, the finish is toasty with cloves. Pair it with hamburgers.\n11452\tSpain\tCrianza\t91\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?�a Olabarri 2011 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tVi?�a Olabarri\tGT_90_Points\tToasty, warm, charred aromas accent earthy, enticing plum and prune scents. This ripe, round, well-structured Rioja is moderately deep on the palate but also bouncy and elegant. Earthy baked-plum flavors come with leathery accents and savory oak, while the finish is lasting and balanced. Drink through 2018.\n87395\tUS\tDue Anni\t86\t18\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tPatterson NV Due Anni Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tRed Blend\tPatterson\tLT_90_Points\tMostly Malbec (34%) and Petit Verdot (32%), this nonvintage blend offers up-front oak notes of vanilla and dill. These are followed by cherry cola, green herbs and a whiff of volatility, along with sweet flavors and grippy tannins.\n26041\tPortugal\tVinha Padre Pedro\t84\t14\tTejo\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCasa Cadaval 2015 Vinha Padre Pedro Ros?? (Tejo)\tRos??\tCasa Cadaval\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a ripe, fruity wine full of wild strawberry fruit. It is soft although with fine acidity and a crisp aftertaste. The wine is ready to drink.\n77418\tUS\tEstate Cuv??e\t87\t32\tOregon\tMcMinnville\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tMaysara 2007 Estate Cuv??e Pinot Noir (McMinnville)\tPinot Noir\tMaysara\tLT_90_Points\tThis is young, quite sharp and still showing some rough edges. The fruit is crisp and pure, with well-defined flavors of raspberry and cherry candy.

It comes from the Grand Cru village of Avize, reflecting the chalk soil in its structure. Drink from 2019.\n12502\tUS\tBrut\t86\t25\tNew York\tFinger Lakes\tFinger Lakes\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\t\tSwedish Hill 2003 Brut Sparkling (Finger Lakes)\tSparkling Blend\tSwedish Hill\tLT_90_Points\tEnticingly nutty on the nose, with hints of smoke, yeast and apricot kernel, this 2003 vintage bottling from Swedish Hill shows promising signs of development. While fairly aggressive on the attack, it's clean and lemony on the palate, with a softly saline, sea breeze note on the finish.\n10491\tPortugal\tLagoalva Reserva\t90\t\tTejo\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tQuinta da Lagoalva de Cima 2014 Lagoalva Reserva White (Tejo)\tPortuguese White\tQuinta da Lagoalva de Cima\tGT_90_Points\tA wood-aged blend of Chardonnay and Arinto, this is a rich, dense wine.

The flavors are equally light, evoking red mulberry fruit and turned earth.

The palate does not disappoint and sings with translucent, light-footed elegance. This is all about charm and ease, about chiffon rather than velvet. Crisp freshness brightens and lightens everything.

Red cherries push through the crisp acidity that offers a zingy texture. The touch of minerality in the 40-year-old vines from the Chapoly vineyard granite soil gives an austere, structured aftertaste.\n32971\tGermany\tHattenheimer Sch?�tzenhaus Kabinett Trocken\t90\t25\tRheingau\t\t\tAnna Lee C.

A hint of mineral marks the finish.\n14593\tUS\tKronos Vineyard\t94\t98\tCalifornia\tSt. Helena\tNapa\t\t\tCorison 2005 Kronos Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (St. Helena)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCorison\tGT_90_Points\tThis winery has had a reputation for making Cabs in a leaner, more ageworthy style, but that is no longer true, to judge by this '05. It's as ripe and fruity as anything out there, and immediately drinkable for its beautiful blackberry, black currant, chocolate and cedar flavors. Still, the tannins are considerable, and the wine should easily negotiate the years. Best now and through 2013, at the least.\n55841\tUS\tPerrydale Hills Vineyard Off-Dry\t87\t22\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tSamuel Robert 2016 Perrydale Hills Vineyard Off-Dry Riesling (Willamette Valley)\tRiesling\tSamuel Robert\tLT_90_Points\tThe winery offers this bottling as a counterpart to their dry Riesling, but there's not much separation between the two. Its 10 g/L of residual sugar is certainly above threshhold, but with the searingly tart acidity underneath, it barely makes a dent. Citrus and apple flavors come through, but the sour lemon acidity is what dominates.\n107217\tUS\t\t89\t35\tCalifornia\tSanta Ynez Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tRideau 2016 Viognier (Santa Ynez Valley)\tViognier\tRideau\tLT_90_Points\tVery light in the glass, this bottling shows peach, melon, apple and key lime pith, which cuts through the riper elements.

That sensibility carries to the palate, where touches of yellow apple, sea salt, faint banana and a shred of bubblegum converge for a complete yet restrained white wine experience.\n93095\tUS\tCoast Range Estate\t92\t49\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\t\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tTrisaetum 2015 Coast Range Estate Pinot Noir\tPinot Noir\tTrisaetum\tGT_90_Points\tThis cool site, set on sedimentary and volcanic soils, brings a blend of five clones into focus. Dark and juicy, muscular and complex, it weaves together plum and cherry fruit, a whiff of truffle, and finishes with a touch of coffee from the barrel aging.\n8721\tItaly\tContado\t88\t17\tSouthern Italy\tMolise\t\t\t\tDi Majo Norante 2005 Contado Aglianico (Molise)\tAglianico\tDi Majo Norante\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a modern, New World wine that boasts plush softness and a thick, velvety texture.

The palate offers stone fruit ripeness but is driven by a sharp, citrusy acidity of Meyer lemon and Mexican lime.\n51349\tArgentina\tGran Enemigo Gualtallary Single Vineyard\t94\t90\tMendoza Province\tMendoza\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Enemigo 2013 Gran Enemigo Gualtallary Single Vineyard Cabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon (Mendoza)\tCabernet Franc-Cabernet Sauvignon\tEl Enemigo\tGT_90_Points\tWinemaker/owner Alejandro Vigil keeps the hits coming with this complex but highly appealing blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. Robust aromas of balsamic black fruits and licorice ease into a round lush tannic palate. Lightly herbal flavors of blackberry, cassis, pepper and baking spices end with spicy chocolaty oak and licorice flavors. Drink this whopper through 2024.\n110121\tUS\t\t89\t27\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tThe Four Graces 2006 Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley)\tPinot Noir\tThe Four Graces\tLT_90_Points\tLight, tart and carrying its cherry, pomegranate and cranberry fruit with precision, this lovely bottle will satisfy those who like their fruit upfront, and also those who want some substance on the back end. Pleasing roasted coffee and chocolate streaks reflect the aging for over 10 months in French oak (30% new). There's a well-managed earthy note also, adding depth and interest.\n66508\tFrance\t\t88\t12\tBordeaux\tBordeaux Blanc\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tCh?�teau de Marsan 2016  Bordeaux Blanc\tBordeaux-style White Blend\tCh?�teau de Marsan\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine is tight, crisp with citrus flavors and intense acidity.

It seems to elevate the aromatics, pushing lush scents of lemon drop, pineapple, and candied orange peel forward. Those perfectly rendered citrus peel flavors put a frame around the tart fruit, and there is a hint of white pepper in the spicy finish.\n2233\tItaly\tMadre\t94\t73\tTuscany\tToscana\t\t\t\tPoggio Antico 2009 Madre Red (Toscana)\tRed Blend\tPoggio Antico\tGT_90_Points\tMadre is the name of a beautiful vineyard parcel on the Poggio Antico estate, with views that extend from Montalcino to the Mediterranean Sea.

Full bodied in blackberry and black cherry, it's refined but has a bite of tannin and power that keep it interesting. It finishes in smooth vanilla and chocolate.\n30801\tAustria\tRied Klaus Federspiel\t92\t36\tWachau\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?�MW\t@AnneInVino\tJosef Jamek 2014 Ried Klaus Federspiel Riesling (Wachau)\tRiesling\tJosef Jamek\tGT_90_Points\tLuscious stone fruit streams into the nose, while the palate reins this richness in with straight-laced citrus.

There is a creamy lemon freshness, too: an internationally recogniable Chardonnay style but with the purity of Austrian fruit and continental freshness.\n125115\tUS\tThe Chairman Series\t88\t42\tCalifornia\tSanta Ynez Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tFirestone 2014 The Chairman Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Santa Ynez Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tFirestone\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a very dry and dusty wine. That experience starts on the nose, where dried oregano, pencil shavings and bittersweet-chocolate aromas meet with restrained blackberry juice. The herbal wave carries into the sip, with marjoram, bay leaf and dill playing into slightly sour black-plum fruit.\n8113\tItaly\tLa Marega\t93\t92\tVeneto\tAmarone della Valpolicella Classico\t\tKerin O�??Keefe\t@kerinokeefe\tLe Salette 2013 La Marega  (Amarone della Valpolicella Classico)\tRed Blend\tLe Salette\tGT_90_Points\tAlluring aromas of exotic spice, purple flower, dark-skinned berry and a balsamic note lead the nose.

It gives heat and the sweet, glyceriney finish of a minor Port. The flavors are also too ripe for comfort, with raisins, prunes and brown sugar.\n14218\tItaly\tSud\t88\t15\tSouthern Italy\tSalice Salentino\t\t\t\tFeudi di San Marzano 2010 Sud Red (Salice Salentino)\tRed Blend\tFeudi di San Marzano\tLT_90_Points\tRich and opulent, this opens with toasted aromas of spice and nut, backed by accents of ripe fruit and blackberry jelly.

There's lots of clean, fresh energy on the palate, powered by flavors of green apple skins, Mexican lime juice, a pinch of dill and a flash of butter on the finish.\n93509\tPortugal\t\t88\t16\tRibatejano\t\t\tRoger Voss\t@vossroger\tQuinta da Alorna 2004 Red (Ribatejano)\tPortuguese Red\tQuinta da Alorna\tLT_90_Points\tThis is an elegant, restrained blend of Tinta Roriz, Castel?�o, Syrah and Alicante Bouschet, giving ripe fruit to go with the firm, dry tannins and a touch of wood.

The wine has noticeable residual sugar as well. This seems way out of any varietal norm for Oregon Pinot Gris, but other than that, it's perfectly quaffable.\n99829\tSpain\t\t89\t18\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFulget 2007 Albari?�o (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?�o\tFulget\tLT_90_Points\tFulget is yet another rock-solid Albari?�o from 2007, a cool year that favored balanced whites throughout Spain. Flower blossoms, apple and mineral aromas set it off. The flavor profile mostly settles on orange, and if there's a weakness it's that there isn't much variety or layering of flavors.

It doesn't make it any less bizarre. The problem is the alcohol doesn't blend with the grape juice, with two elements sitting alongside each other. This wine, with its sweet fruit flavor of marmalade that is cut by a strong brandy spirit sharpness, is for those who like strange drinks.

At first glance, the fruit seems a bit cooked or pruny, but within a few minutes it brightens and turns livelier, coming across as cherry. There's a mushroomy or meaty note as well�??something akin to venison�??and a rich texture on the palate.\n126374\tGermany\tRosa-Goldlack Beerenauslese 375 ml\t91\t\tRheingau\t\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSchloss Johannisberger 2007 Rosa-Goldlack Beerenauslese 375 ml Riesling (Rheingau)\tRiesling\tSchloss Johannisberger\tGT_90_Points\tModerately sweet and viscous, without the intense concentration seen in some of the vintage's BAs, this remains a skilfully balanced wine, with candied pineapple, citrus and honey balanced by fresh acidity.

The barrel aromas (24 months in all-new French) stand out at first, with notes of chocolate, coffee and spice. The black-fruit flavors are full bodied and high-octane, showing some warmth on the finish.

It might be mistaken for Chardonnay, except for the extra weight that carries through the lengthy finish. Though it's tempting to describe white Pinot Noirs as sparkling wines without the sparkle, this is much more interesting, and one of the rare examples that defines both a style and a standard for the rest.\n33223\tArgentina\tClasico\t86\t10\tMendoza Province\tMendoza\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGauchezco 2010 Clasico Malbec (Mendoza)\tMalbec\tGauchezco\tLT_90_Points\tMinerally dark-berry aromas come with a touch of spice.

Ample honey and buttered-toast notes from oak give it warmth. It's a very good Chard for drinking now with rich shellfish dishes, or a buttery wild mushroom risotto.\n115394\tUS\t\t88\t30\tCalifornia\tSonoma Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tSchug 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Sonoma Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tSchug\tLT_90_Points\tA tart austere red wine blended with 13% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 3% Malbec, there's a tangy element of currant and pomegranate that provides freshness here if not complexity.

It's lush in black-cherry flavor, accented with chocolate, black pepper, vanilla and spice, but also densely tannic and searing in acidity.

It doesn't show the delicacy or silkiness of a classic Russian River Pinot Noir, being a little heavy and full-bodied.

This is a Pinot made in a light, coastal style; it offers red cherry, cough drop and tea-like flavors in front of a lasting, unforced but mild finish. A year in French oak has added a buttery element, and overall the wine rings true but distant.\n13764\tChile\t\t83\t20\tAconcagua Costa\t\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tArboleda 2013 Pinot Noir (Aconcagua Costa)\tPinot Noir\tArboleda\tLT_90_Points\tTangy, citrusy aromas suggest sour plum and cranberry.

The alcohol is high and the wine is very dry, a full-throttle assault on the senses, with its maximum load of jammy fruit. Nothing subtle, just a bases-loaded, ripe wine that leaves little to the imagination. Best Buy.\n114185\tUS\t\t87\t21\tNew York\tNorth Fork of Long Island\tLong Island\tAnna Lee C.

Even at nine years of age, this is impressively dark and intense, with minty notes, cedar and vanilla and meaty, umami-like flavors that linger on the long, silky finish.

Cedar, cassis, sage and bay leaf notes are classic Margaret River expressions, as is the wine's medium body and streamlined feel. It's a harmonious if not particularly flamboyant wine that will be at home with a variety of dishes.

There's plenty of fruit to back up the lavish oak treatment, but this wine needs 3�??5 years to integrate its cassis fruit with the overlay of vanilla, chocolate and toasted coconut. It seems a bit coarsely textured at first, then smoothes out nicely with air, gaining length on the finish.

The style is resolutely traditional, with crisp acids and a wiry backbone the standout features. Cedary oak further frames tart cherry fruit, which finishes long and crisp. Drink from 2018 through until 2025.\n101114\tAustralia\tDry Red Wine No. 1\t92\t75\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYarra Yering 2007 Dry Red Wine No. 1 Red (Yarra Valley)\tRed Blend\tYarra Yering\tGT_90_Points\tA Yarra Valley classic, Dry Red No. 1 is a Bordeaux-style blend marked by its restrained alcohol levels yet potent flavors. The 2007 features scents of tobacco, vanilla and cassis, with a hint of tomato emerging on the palate. It's medium-bodied, with a long finish that finishes with firm but silky tannins and lip-smacking cassis. Approachable now, but should age well for 10�??15 years.\n46915\tAustralia\tVintage Cuv??e\t93\t44\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJansz 2010 Vintage Cuv??e Sparkling (Tasmania)\tSparkling Blend\tJansz\tGT_90_Points\tThis rivals good Champagne in its toasty, buttery-brioche richness, then adds cashew and citrus for an assertive blast of balanced flavor.

Full-bodied and creamy textured, this densely concentrated wine should be at its best now-2020.\n56454\tAustralia\t\t91\t29\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJenke 2002 Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tJenke\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine is much more convincing than Jenke's 2005 Cabernet, reinforcing the concept that Barossa Cab typically performs better in cooler years (2002 was the coolest on record). It's still broad and mouthfilling, but the plum and cassis flavors stay this side of overripe, buttressed by plenty of smoke, vanilla and spice. Long and savory on the finish. Drink now�??2015.

Tannins are silky-smooth, suggesting early drinkability, although it should age well until at least 2015.\n91633\tAustralia\t\t92\t15\tVictoria\tGrampians\t\t\t\tPoint Ormond 2015 Sangiovese (Grampians)\tSangiovese\tPoint Ormond\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine is spot on with the modern Aussie movement towards light-bodied, moderate-alcohol wines, with little to no oak influence. From the cool climes of Western Victoria, this is downright delicious and a total bargain. Bright, ripe red cherry, chocolate, cola and violet notes lead into a plush yet zingy palate of juicy red fruits, silky soft tannins and a long tangy finish.\n114575\tAustralia\tRSW\t92\t70\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWirra Wirra 2012 RSW Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tWirra Wirra\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine sees less new oak than many top-of-the-line Shiraz (30%), so it showcases mulberry and black cherry fruit. Sure, there's a hint of vanilla, but the oak plays a suitably supporting role, while the ripe fruit tannins are rich and velvety on the midpalate, then firm up a bit on the finish.

Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tR Wines\tGT_90_Points\tRather subdued in fruit on the nose, showing more vanilla and toast, but this really expands on the palate, delivering great fruit sweetness and nuance in a harmoniously round, supple package.

Vanilla accents lifted sour cherry and cranberry aromas, but on the palate the flavors darken and deepen, trending toward black cherries and plum. Has a nicely balanced, silky texture in the mouth, then a firm, long finish suggesting cellaring. Drink 2012-2025.\n119979\tAustralia\tFarrago\t90\t66\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKooyong 2013 Farrago Chardonnay (Mornington Peninsula)\tChardonnay\tKooyong\tGT_90_Points\tWithout any new oak or lees stirring, this wine's sole focus is on the fruit. Pineapple, melon and peach notes are pure and striking, supported by just hints of vanilla and cream. This medium-bodied Chardonnay finishes in a flurry of tangerine and lime.\n118404\tAustralia\tTarraford Vineyard\t90\t42\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGiant Steps 2013 Tarraford Vineyard Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)\tChardonnay\tGiant Steps\tGT_90_Points\tThis reasonably full-bodied Chardonnay manages to retain a sense of freshness and crispness throughout.

Starts off in the mouth with a burst of sweetness, and a limey, grassy streak carries it through to the finish. Nose is fruity, with nectarine and mango highlights.\n24496\tAustralia\tSV\t90\t28\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLoom 2013 SV Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Noir\tLoom\tGT_90_Points\tIt's refreshing to see another importer take a chance on Pinot Noir from the Adelaide Hills, a region that can reliably ripen the variety at reasonable crop loads. This is a rounder, more supple style of Pinot than most from Australia, with cola, spice and cherry notes reminiscent of Dr. Pepper, or of some Pinots from California's Russian River Valley. Drink now�??2020.\n23987\tAustralia\t\t93\t37\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChapel Hill 2010 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tChapel Hill\tGT_90_Points\tPowerful and concentrated, this Shiraz is seemingly imbued with the essence of dark fruit, framed by well-managed oak. Cedar, mint and cassis notes are a bit Cabernet-like, but the structure is pure Shiraz, broader and suppler than Cabernet, with a rich texture and a long finish. Drink now�??2025.\n11891\tAustralia\tArt Series\t90\t22\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeeuwin Estate 2015 Art Series Riesling (Margaret River)\tRiesling\tLeeuwin Estate\tGT_90_Points\tTasted blind, this wasn't particularly different from the other Rieslings in its flight, which were predominantly South Australian. It's got those same wet stone and citrus tendencies and is made in the same medium-bodied, dry, high-acid style. There's a touch of pineapple as well, plus a long, dry crisp finish.\n60960\tAustralia\tThe Struie\t93\t50\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2006 The Struie Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tA blend of Shiraz from Eden Valley and the valley floor, this is both amply endowed and impressively complex.

Elements of graham cracker, espresso, dark chocolate and baking spices are bolstered by ample weight and berry fruit. Enjoy this velvety wine over the short term�??by 2018 or so.\n56438\tAustralia\tOdyssey\t92\t60\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKatnook Estate 2002 Odyssey Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tKatnook Estate\tGT_90_Points\tKatnook's top-of-the-line Cab, the Odyssey, already seems mature, with a touch of brick to its color and some dried fruit flavors. But even if this won't improve further, it's at a lovely spot right now, with a lush, creamy texture, pillowy-soft tannins and wonderful cedar and cigarbox notes. Drink now�??2010.\n38269\tAustralia\tJulius\t90\t37\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenschke 2012 Julius Riesling (Eden Valley)\tRiesling\tHenschke\tGT_90_Points\tThis is surprisingly plump and accessible, featuring scents of lime rind upfront, then flavors of apple, nectarine and citrus. A medium-bodied wine with a long, mouthwatering finish, it's a tasty near-term drinker but should develop well for up to 10 years.\n3554\tAustralia\tWilliam Randell\t92\t50\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThorn Clarke 2010 William Randell Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tThorn Clarke\tGT_90_Points\tThis luxury cuv??e from Thorne Clarke combines ripe berries with cinnamon and clove, then adds dollops of vanilla and chocolate, yet never seems overly sweet. Likewise, it's full bodied and rich, yet never goes over the top, maintaining a sense of freshness and structure. Drink now�??2020, and possibly beyond.\n28131\tAustralia\tReserve\t90\t40\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tStonier 2005 Reserve Pinot Noir (Mornington Peninsula)\tPinot Noir\tStonier\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine nicely captures Pinot Noir's elusive silky texture and weight without heaviness, then combines those attributes with complex earthy flavors and touches of sassafras and cola.

A hint of mint or eucalyptus enlivens the bouquet and helps to lighten this otherwise rather full-bodied, brooding wine. Finishes long, with enough dusty tannins to warrant cellaring through 2015.\n62372\tAustralia\tHarry & Edward's Garden\t90\t60\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTwo Hands 2006 Harry & Edward's Garden Shiraz (Langhorne Creek)\tShiraz\tTwo Hands\tGT_90_Points\tLike all of the 2006 Garden offerings from Two Hands, this one is full-bodied, creamy and makes a slightly sweet impression on the palate because of its combination of high alcohol (15.2%) and superripe fruit.

Attractive rose-petal and dry earth aromas lead the way, followed by notes of black cherries and licorice on the palate. It's a bit full-bodied and muscular, a Pinot more for steak than salmon.\n46784\tAustralia\tFour Vineyards Gods Hill Road Lyndoch\t91\t30\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDutschke 2006 Four Vineyards Gods Hill Road Lyndoch Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tDutschke\tGT_90_Points\tHews closely to the Dutschke style: Full and soft, with slightly jammy dark cherry-berry notes accented by cedar and Mexican chocolate.

Right now, it's showing only some subtle oak and spice framing dark fruit and earthy, savory notes. With its apparent richness and depth, give it until 2015 or so to come around, then drink it over the next 10 years.\n73154\tAustralia\tPolish Hill River\t91\t26\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPauletts 2008 Polish Hill River Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tPauletts\tGT_90_Points\tA rich, amply endowed Clare Riesling, with potent lime aromas accented by touches of petrol, plenty of flavor intensity and a long finish composed of citrus and spice. Hints of baked apple and petrol suggest it may not be the longest-lived Riesling, but it's delicious now and should be good for another five years or so.\n68785\tAustralia\tSt. Andrews\t91\t50\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWakefield 2004 St. Andrews Cabernet Sauvignon (Clare Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tWakefield\tGT_90_Points\tThis top Cabernet bottling from Taylors has been a consistent favorite over the last few vintages, and the 2004 continues the string. It's complex, bringing scents of mint, coffee, cassis and tobacco all to the dance, and matching that complexity with weight and richness. The tannins are a bit astringent right now, so try it from 2010-2020.\n69018\tAustralia\tThe Beauty\t91\t50\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHentley Farm 2007 The Beauty Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tHentley Farm\tGT_90_Points\tOnly slightly less rich than its Beast counterpart, the 2007 Beauty is a full-bodied wine nonetheless.

Bold cassis fruit is balanced by earthy, meaty complexity and finishes long and mouthwatering. Drinkable now, but it should hold easily through 2020, and possibly longer.\n69514\tAustralia\tThe Freedom 1843\t94\t100\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLangmeil 2008 The Freedom 1843 Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tLangmeil\tGT_90_Points\tNamed for the year the vineyard was planted, this is a full-bore Barossa fruit bomb�??in a positive way.

Nearly impenetrable at first on the nose, this reluctantly giving up hints of plum, cocoa and earth. The plum-pudding palate is dense and weighty, with savory overtones. Give it until 2018 or 2020 to unclench and brighten up.\n28120\tAustralia\tHickinbotham\t90\t65\tSouth Australia\tClarendon\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tClarendon Hills 2005 Hickinbotham Grenache (Clarendon)\tGrenache\tClarendon Hills\tGT_90_Points\tRipe black cherry and cedary aromas can't hide the touch of alcohol that seems to emanate from the glass. But the wine is balanced on the palate, not showing any excessive warmth, framing its black cherry and chocolate flavors with bright acidity. The crisp acids on the finish accentuate the tannins, making this an uncommonly structured Grenache.

While the range has expanded over time, Cabernet Sauvignon remains a strength. Brown sugar and cedar frame cassis fruit on the nose; the palate shows just enough juicy, mouthwatering fruit to support the ample oak. This is full bodied yet supple, with crisp acids showing on the finish.\n119999\tAustralia\tSavitar\t92\t75\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMitolo 2012 Savitar Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tMitolo\tGT_90_Points\tVanilla, cedar and mint notes mark the nose, while this wine boasts just enough fruit on the plate to carry the lavish oak.

It takes its time opening up in the glass to reveal notes of grilled meat, vanilla and plum. In the mouth, it's full bodied and firmly built, with a wall of chewy tannins surrounding a deep ripe core.\n3080\tAustralia\tDescendant\t94\t105\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2007 Descendant Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz-Viognier\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tFull bodied and concentrated without being overly heavy or tannic, this is a stunning blend of Shiraz (92%) and Viognier (8%).

Vaguely minty, herbal notes make a brief appearance, then give way to raspberry and blueberry fruit. Savory  hints creep in on the palate, further increasing its appeal. This blend of fruit from the Barossa and Eden valleys should drink well through at least 2020.\n111597\tAustralia\tShotfire\t90\t22\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThorn Clarke 2010 Shotfire Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tThorn Clarke\tGT_90_Points\tAn excellent value, the 2010 Shotfire Shiraz offers bold, punched-up cherry-berry fruit framed by hints of vanilla, dried herbs and cracked pepper.

Over time, the odors evolve toward smoke and ash, and, finally, into a complex, cedary aroma. The flavors of this medium-bodied blend (80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Malbec, 8% Merlot, 2% Petit Verdot) feature blackberry and cassis, but also fold in hints of smoked meat and vanilla before finishing crisp and long.

There are enough hints of bright, raspberry-tinged fruit to warrant optimism about its aging trajectory, but at the moment it is dark, heavy and slightly scorched. Try after 2017.\n11098\tAustralia\tReserve\t91\t18\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\t\t\tJacob's Creek 1998 Reserve Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tJacob's Creek\tGT_90_Points\tThe blackberry, vanilla and toasty oak elements are nicely balanced on the nose and in the mouth. Deep fruit shines, and the supple mouthfeel is very appealing. Finishes long, with a compelling back-end bouquet that completes the package in fine style.\n61149\tAustralia\tTerra Barossa\t91\t15\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThorn Clarke 2013 Terra Barossa Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tThorn Clarke\tGT_90_Points\tA terrific value if you can find it (alas, only 150 cases were imported), this is full bodied and richly textured, marrying hints of peppery spice with grilled lavender and rosemary that perfectly season the beach cherry and mocha flavors. It's stout, tannic and mouth coating on the finish, ideal for matching with roasts or steaks. Drink 2018�??2025.\n99340\tAustralia\tLes Amis\t95\t185\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2013 Les Amis Grenache (Barossa Valley)\tGrenache\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tThis rich, opulent wine carries its massive oak load easily, marrying vanilla and toasted coconut notes with ripe plum and black cherry flavors. It's full bodied and plush, with supple tannins supported by the wood. Give it a few years to knit together and drink it 2020�??2030.\n99318\tAustralia\tMount Edelstone Vineyard\t95\t200\tSouth Australia\tEden Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenschke 2014 Mount Edelstone Vineyard Shiraz (Eden Valley)\tShiraz\tHenschke\tGT_90_Points\tFrom vines planted in 1912, this has been an icon of South Australia Shiaz since 1952, when it was first bottled as a single-vineyard wine. Menthol and vanilla notes frame black cherries and cassis on the nose, while the palate reveals supple tannins and meaty, savory complexities. The finish is softly dusty, fine and long. Drink now�??2030.\n11092\tAustralia\tLimited Release\t92\t50\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\t\t\tJacob's Creek 1998 Limited Release Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon (South Australia)\tShiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon\tJacob's Creek\tGT_90_Points\tJacob's Creek's top-end red is complex, dense and supple. A seductive bouquet of cassis, Asian spice, leather, cocoa and smoke pulls you in and the palate delivers with a thick, velvety feel and concentrated black fruit. Dry, but ripe and even tannins on the long finish portend a good future for this already attractive wine. Cellar Selection.\n107783\tAustralia\tNo. 11\t90\t30\tNew South Wales\tOrange\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPhilip Shaw 2006 No. 11 Chardonnay (Orange)\tChardonnay\tPhilip Shaw\tGT_90_Points\tA bit unyielding on the nose, then the palate shows rather tight and citrusy flavors. Yet there's ample weight on the palate and a long, fresh finish tinged with hard peaches and pineapple. This seemingly contradictory wine just needs some time to develop; try after 2009.\n2517\tAustralia\tRunRig\t94\t225\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2010 RunRig Shiraz-Viognier (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz-Viognier\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tA perplexing wine to evaluate, the 2010 RunRig (97% Shiraz and 3% Viognier) evolves rapidly once poured, going from slightly stewed and overoaked to a wine that shows considerable class within 20 minutes or so. Aromas and flavors of brown sugar, mocha and roasted meat give way to raspberry compote, while the creamy texture and supple tannins conceal the wine's high alcohol level with ease.\n89928\tAustralia\tGreen's Vineyard\t93\t104\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKilikanoon 2008 Green's Vineyard Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tKilikanoon\tGT_90_Points\tFull bodied and richly textured, this is a terrific example of Barossa Shiraz. From its smoky aromas and intense, briary scents to its complex, earthy, spicy flavors with an undercurrent of blackberry, this is a complete package. The long finish is slightly chewy, suggesting that additional aging is warranted. Drink 2016�??2025.\n72763\tAustralia\tDiana Madeline\t93\t109\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCullen 2013 Diana Madeline Red (Margaret River)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tCullen\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a wonderful counterpoint to Vasse Felix's Heytesbury. Where that wine is lush, this is more austere, with restrained, Bordeaux-reminiscent sensibilities. Smoky, grilled elements frame cassis and mint, finishing with classic firm tannins and admirable length. Drink 2023�??2035, although the back label suggests �??up to a further 30 years.�??\n73012\tAustralia\tThe Olive Grove\t90\t17\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale-Adelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2014 The Olive Grove Chardonnay (McLaren Vale-Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tSubtle notes of toasted grain frame citrus and peach fruit in this well-priced offering. It's not the biggest, most robust Chardonnay, but it delivers intensity allied to length, turning lemony on the powerful finish. Drink now�??2020.\n29225\tAustralia\tPrelude Vineyards\t92\t36\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeeuwin Estate 2012 Prelude Vineyards Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tLeeuwin Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThis is remarkably lush and full-bodied, yet remains lively and mouthwatering. Toasted nuts frame ample flavors of grilled pineapple and melon. Drink now�??2017. The success of this wine should be a good indicator that, when released, the 2012 Art Series will be something spectacular.\n73015\tAustralia\t\t90\t19\tVictoria\tRutherglen\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCampbells NV Muscat (Rutherglen)\tMuscat\tCampbells\tGT_90_Points\tDried figs, dates and maple syrup aromas are just what's expected from this deep amber-hued wine. It's full and sweet, adding some orange-rind notes and a hint of pith on the warming finish.\n73016\tAustralia\tReserve\t90\t18\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCriterion 2013 Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCriterion\tGT_90_Points\tCriterion is a so-called global brand, offering Italian Pinot Grigio, Rioja and Chianti Classico among other benchmarks. This Coonawarra Cabernet is surprisingly good given that background. It offers cherry, cassis and tobacco notes, medium body and silky tannins. Drink it over the next 5�??8 years.\n45031\tAustralia\tThe Medhyk Old Vine\t94\t95\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAngove 2012 The Medhyk Old Vine Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tAngove\tGT_90_Points\tA tip of the cap to the Angove family for turning out such an ageworthy wine. It's packed and stacked with mulberry fruit, lashings of vanilla and just a hint of mint. Full-bodied and tannic, it should drink well from 2020�??2030.\n24439\tAustralia\tTwins\t92\t25\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMaverick 2014 Twins Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tMaverick\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a fine example of what Barossa Shiraz is capable of at a realistic price. It's full bodied and richly textured, plush without being too soft. French oak brings a smoky, bacony element to the ripe blueberry fruit, plus a dusting of baking spices that lingers on the finish. Drink now�??2025.\n86243\tAustralia\tYattarna\t91\t66\tSouth Australia\tHenty\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPenfolds 2004 Yattarna Chardonnay (Henty)\tChardonnay\tPenfolds\tGT_90_Points\tDespite being a 2004 vintage wine, this top-shelf Chardonnay from Penfolds is still embryonic in its development, shrouded in some smoky, tarry, coffee-like aromas that call for brisk decanting. Underneath, you'll find richly textured layers of ripe, honeyed fruit and grilled peaches, ending with lingering notes of citrus. Drink now�??2015.\n77881\tAustralia\tBush Vine\t92\t36\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChapel Hill 2010 Bush Vine Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tChapel Hill\tGT_90_Points\tFor an Australian Grenache, this has an invitingly cool, herbal bouquet, hinting at dried flowers and black tea. But it's unapologetically full-bodied and rich on the palate, adding black cherries and dark chocolate to the mix. It's warm, velvety and almost fudge-like on the finish yet not raisiny at all. Drink it over ?the next few years.\n23211\tAustralia\tThe Vagabond Old Vine\t90\t50\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThistledown 2013 The Vagabond Old Vine Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tThistledown\tGT_90_Points\tJust tiny amounts of this wine (25 cases) are available in the U.S. market, but it represents a trend in Australia of celebrating old-vine Grenache. A blend of two parcels from the Blewitt Springs and Seaview subregions, this is silky in texture, with crisp red cherries shot through with herbal streaks and a slightly warm finish.\n90591\tAustralia\tOld Block\t93\t69\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSt Hallett 2010 Old Block Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tSt Hallett\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a savory style of Shiraz that remains very drinkable. Despite being full-bodied, it's bright and refreshing on the palate, delivering notions of cracked pepper, sour plum and roasted meat. The long finish is simultaneously dusty and mouth-watering. Drink now�??2025.\n90598\tAustralia\tAmery Vineyard Hillside\t93\t60\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKay Brothers 2012 Amery Vineyard Hillside Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tKay Brothers\tGT_90_Points\tLike it's slightly more elevated cousin, Kay's Block 6 Shiraz, this is full bodied and almost painfully concentrated. Lovely oak-derived notes of cinnamon, vanilla and mocha cosset roasted meat and blueberries, then glide to a long, dusty finish. Drink 2020�??2030.\n63549\tAustralia\tCoal River Valley Single Site\t90\t65\tTasmania\tTasmania\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDalrymple 2012 Coal River Valley Single Site Pinot Noir (Tasmania)\tPinot Noir\tDalrymple\tGT_90_Points\tThis is strongly marked by new oak on the nose at this stage, suggesting toast, brown sugar and coffee, but fruit comes through on the palate where hints of dark berries, cola, clove and cinnamon mingle. The wine is creamy and lush in texture, with ample weight and a lingering finish of dried fruit, vanilla and mocha. Drink from 2018 to 2025.\n68677\tAustralia\tTrueman\t93\t75\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHickinbotham 2013 Trueman Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tHickinbotham\tGT_90_Points\tAustere, tannic and chewy, this Cabernet could use a few years in the cellar. Classic mint and cassis notes are framed by cedar and vanilla, but the fruit comes through on the firm, dusty finish, a sign of positive things to come. Drink 2020�??2030.\n113027\tAustralia\t\t90\t20\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBrokenwood 2015 Semillon (Hunter Valley)\tS??millon\tBrokenwood\tGT_90_Points\tLike most young Hunter Valley Semillons, this is starting out on the neutral, acidic side. Notes of melon and citrus rind only hint at the potential to be found in a few years' time. It's a little weightier than expected, with a silky mouthfeel and a long, gentle, lime-riddled finish.\n113029\tAustralia\tThree Hills\t90\t50\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHapps 2014 Three Hills Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tHapps\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a lush, amply oaked wine, brimming with the things that make Margaret River Chardonnay so lovable. Grilled bread and fruit abound, pushing forth peach, pineapple and melon flavors through a soft, espresso-tinged finish. Drink now�??2020.\n63562\tAustralia\tThe Dagger\t90\t20\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRiposte 2014 The Dagger Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Noir\tRiposte\tGT_90_Points\tTim Knappstein's decision to focus on the Adelaide Hills bears fruit in this terrific-value Pinot Noir. The aromas and flavors are a colorful m??lange of beets, black cherries and purple heirloom tomatoes, backed by a rich texture and a long velvety finish. Drink now until 2020.\n116880\tAustralia\tSt. Hugo\t91\t35\tSouth Australia\tCoonawarra\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJacob's Creek 2008 St. Hugo Cabernet Sauvignon (Coonawarra)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tJacob's Creek\tGT_90_Points\tYes, the same Jacob's Creek that turns out vast quantities of drink-me-now wines at sub-$10 price points also makes this age-worthy Cabernet from Coonawarra fruit. The 2008 is a harmonious wine, blending notes of cassis, cigar box and vanilla into a richly textured, fairly tannic whole. Give it 4�??5 years in the cellar.\n116883\tAustralia\tMort's Reserve Watervale\t91\t35\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKilikanoon 2011 Mort's Reserve Watervale Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tKilikanoon\tGT_90_Points\tLean and tightly focused, this looks like one for the cellar�??try it around 2018 if you can wait. Right now, it shows modest, restrained citrus fruit, hints of wet stone and a wickedly long, sinewy finish.\n79936\tAustralia\tEric Stevens Purbrick\t90\t66\tVictoria\tNagambie Lakes\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTahbilk 2007 Eric Stevens Purbrick Shiraz (Nagambie Lakes)\tShiraz\tTahbilk\tGT_90_Points\tFrom an inland region of Victoria, this is a mature wine. The tannins are plentiful but soft, wrapped around a core of dried cherries and plums. Hints of cedar and brown sugar add the impression of sweetness, while notes of mint and cracked pepper bring freshness.\n80741\tAustralia\tHeavy Metal\t90\t15\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHungerford Hill 2008 Heavy Metal Shiraz (South Eastern Australia)\tShiraz\tHungerford Hill\tGT_90_Points\tThis is an unusually complex Shiraz for the price, ably marrying meaty-savory notes with tart berries and plenty of weight on the palate. Crisp structure, finishes long, with lingering acids. Drink now�??2018.\n80201\tAustralia\t\t90\t14\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tNine Stones 2007 Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tNine Stones\tGT_90_Points\tStarts off slightly gamy and meaty, then adds bright blueberry fruit and hints of peppery spice. It's creamy-smooth in texture, medium-bodied and nicely balanced on the juicy, mouthwatering finish. A good value red to lay in for summer grilling.\n114276\tAustralia\tReserve\t91\t24\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSidewood 2008 Reserve Syrah (Adelaide Hills)\tSyrah\tSidewood\tGT_90_Points\tInterestingly, Sidewood's 2008 Reserve Shiraz comes in considerably lower in alcohol than the regular bottling. It features a complex interplay of herb, spice and olive that gives it a stylistic resemblance resemblance to northern Rh??ne Syrahs. The tannins are silky, the finish long and balanced. Drink now�??2018.\n15267\tAustralia\t\t92\t40\tSouth Australia\tPadthaway\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenry's Drive Vignerons 2012 Shiraz (Padthaway)\tShiraz\tHenry's Drive Vignerons\tGT_90_Points\tA bit softer, plusher and creamier than the Shiraz-Cabernet from this producer, this is still an impressive wine. Smoky cedar and mocha notes complement plums and blackberries, turning velvety on the finish. Drink now through 2025.\n59453\tAustralia\t\t90\t62\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\t\t\tOccam's Razor 2014 Shiraz (Heathcote)\tShiraz\tOccam's Razor\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a herbaceous expression of Shiraz from the under appreciated Heathcote region of Victoria, and made by Emily Laughton, daughter of the well-regarded Jasper Hill family. Mint and green herbs mingle with potpourri, juicy fruit, and charred oak characters. Tannins are tightly wound at the moment, but the wine is well balanced and here for the long haul. Drink 2020�??2032.\n59455\tAustralia\tThe Experiment Estate Single Vineyard\t90\t36\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\t\t\tPenny's Hill 2015 The Experiment Estate Single Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tPenny's Hill\tGT_90_Points\tA red cherry aroma is interwoven with violets and dried herbs.

The fruit surges forward on the palate, bringing plummy, meaty flavors to the fore. This is fuller bodied than most Yarra Valley Shirazes, with a plush mouthfeel and a long, warm, spicy finish.\n45472\tAustralia\tPrelude Vineyards\t93\t36\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeeuwin Estate 2014 Prelude Vineyards Chardonnay (Margaret River)\tChardonnay\tLeeuwin Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThe Art Series' little brother is all grown up and ready to stand on its own as a terrific wine.

Drink it over the next 10�??12 years.\n51389\tAustralia\tThe Noble Wrinkled\t94\t19\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2008 The Noble Wrinkled Riesling (McLaren Vale)\tRiesling\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tLovely dessert-style Riesling at an extremely attractive price. It yields dried apricot aromas, then turns to honeyed marmalade in the mouth, just loaded with orange-apricot preserves. It's weighty and viscous, with a long, sweet finish. Should last through at least 2016.\n59821\tAustralia\tTiers Vineyard\t93\t70\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTapaNappa 2006 Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay (South Australia)\tChardonnay\tTapaNappa\tGT_90_Points\tBrian Croser's efforts with Tiers Vineyard Chardonnay have finally paid off in a big way. This is a plump, amply textured wine that doesn't lack for elegance, marrying scents and flavors of toasted grain with white peaches and hazelnuts. Long and intense on the finish, echoing with toasty oak but also layers of vibrant fruit.

This is full and velvety, with hints of cedar and vanilla blending easily into the whole. Approachable now, it should age well through at least 2025.\n77796\tAustralia\tLuna\t91\t18\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tWit's End 2014 Luna Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tWit's End\tGT_90_Points\tA splash of Barbera enlivens this wine, which boasts boysenberry, understated earthy notes and a dash of vanilla.

There's a supple cushioning of flesh wrapped around a firm backbone of acid, while the flavors run from black cherry and mint through earthier notes of brown sugar and roasted parsnip. Drink now through 2020.\n106985\tAustralia\tEastside\t91\t28\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPikes 2007 Eastside Shiraz (Clare Valley)\tShiraz\tPikes\tGT_90_Points\tLush and creamy on the palate, this complex wine boasts flavors of slightly mossy, decaying cedar, molasses, damp earth and leather, all wrapped around a bright core of red berry.

Hints of baking spices and leather add complexity and persist through the long finish. It'd be fun to throw this in a blind tasting with some of California's top Zins.\n23073\tAustralia\tJackaman's\t90\t57\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLangmeil 2010 Jackaman's Cabernet Sauvignon (Barossa)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tLangmeil\tGT_90_Points\tThe mint, cassis and baking spice aromas are classic New World Cabernet, as is the wine's ample body and creamy texture. By purist standards, it's too drinkable, too approachable now, with tannins that just glide into the background. Drink now�??2020.\n55937\tAustralia\tArt Series\t91\t45\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLeeuwin Estate 2007 Art Series Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tLeeuwin Estate\tGT_90_Points\tA textbook example of Margaret River Cabernet Sauvignon, the 2007 Art Series offers perfumed cassis fruit just tinged with mint and tobacco. There's ample body yet classic Cabernet restraint, so it's not jammy or overdone. The tannins are supple enough to make it enjoyable now, yet sufficient to see it through 2018, at least.\n80612\tAustralia\tThree Gardens\t92\t20\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLangmeil 2012 Three Gardens Red (Barossa)\tRed Blend\tLangmeil\tGT_90_Points\tThis is nearly equal parts Shiraz, Mataro and Grenache, full bodied and creamy in texture. Black cherries and peppery spice show up on the nose, while the palate adds brighter red raspberries, bass notes of ripe plums, sweet hints of brown sugar and savory, meaty complexity. Drink now�??2020.\n116895\tAustralia\tMangan Malbec-Petit Verdot-Merlot\t91\t46\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCullen 2010 Mangan Malbec-Petit Verdot-Merlot Red (Margaret River)\tRed Blend\tCullen\tGT_90_Points\tCullen's 2010 Mangan captures the great potential of the vintage. It's a youthful, juicy mouthful of berry fruit accented with cedar and vanilla oak, but where the wine really shines is its texture, which is richly silky, with a fine dusty quality reminiscent of cocoa powder or ground cinnamon. Drink it now and over the next several years.\n119697\tAustralia\tAnnexus\t92\t60\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJohn Duval Wines 2013 Annexus Grenache (Barossa)\tGrenache\tJohn Duval Wines\tGT_90_Points\tJohn Duval (ex Penfolds) has finally released a varietal Grenache, a wine that's quite different from the blends and Shirazes he's done up until this point. This is supple, full in body and round, without the firm structural elements his wines typically possess. Dare I say it's hedonistic? Black cherry and cinnamon notes are juicy and mouthwatering on the long finish. Drink now�??2020.\n59977\tAustralia\tThe Peake\t96\t150\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHickinbotham 2013 The Peake Cabernet-Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet-Shiraz\tHickinbotham\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a top example of the classic Australian blend. Cabernet (57%) provides cigar box aromas and elongates the finish, while Shiraz (43%) fills out the midpalate. The combination is full-bodied yet muscular, generous yet firmly structured. Essence of cassis is framed by hints of vanilla and cedar, while the long finish shows off chewy tannins and mouthwatering acids. Drink 2023�??2035, and posssibly beyond.\n72223\tAustralia\tEmily's Paddock Shiraz-Cabernet Franc\t91\t125\tVictoria\tHeathcote\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJasper Hill 2005 Emily's Paddock Shiraz-Cabernet Franc Shiraz (Heathcote)\tShiraz\tJasper Hill\tGT_90_Points\tAlthough there is only 5% Cab Franc in the blend, it appears to have quite an impact on this wine's aromas, which are intriguingly perfumed and contain some minty, leafy notes. Flavors also hint at mint with some subtle cedary notes, although the primary fruit is blueberry. Like the 2005 Georgia's Paddock, it's full-bodied and creamy-textured, although this wine adds a slightly more tannic edge to the finish. Drink 2010�??2020.\n90504\tAustralia\tSt Kitts Vineyard on Truro Volcanic Soil\t90\t30\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThorn Clarke 2008 St Kitts Vineyard on Truro Volcanic Soil Malbec (Barossa Valley)\tMalbec\tThorn Clarke\tGT_90_Points\tA dark, inky purple in color, this is a full-bodied (15.5% alcohol) but gentle Malbec, its vanilla, plum and black olive notes framed by supple tannins and a velvety finish. Drink it over the next several years.\n90510\tAustralia\tSangiovese - Shiraz\t90\t16\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCoriole 2008 Sangiovese - Shiraz Red (McLaren Vale)\tRed Blend\tCoriole\tGT_90_Points\tDespite being 51% Sangiovese, this wine comes across as more Shiraz in style, marked by dark, plummy notes, black olive, tar and coffee. It's medium-bodied, with soft, creamy tannins and a reasonably long finish. Maybe the Sangiovese just brightens things a little. Good value.\n90855\tAustralia\tWild Thing\t91\t20\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tInkwell 2005 Wild Thing Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tInkwell\tGT_90_Points\tThe 2005 Inkwell wines are undeniably big, but they manage to carry their weight and ample alcohol levels with a surprising measure of balance and grace. This one clocks in at 15.7%, but doesn't seem hot or heavy, just mouthfilling and round. Blueberry and blackberry fruit lead the way, but they're joined by earthier notes of black olive, coffee and tree bark. Drink now�??2010.\n68004\tAustralia\tLimited Release\t90\t38\tSouth Australia\tPadthaway\t\t\t\tJacob's Creek 1997 Limited Release Chardonnay (Padthaway)\tChardonnay\tJacob's Creek\tGT_90_Points\tNutty, toasty and tropical-fruit elements are nicely balanced in this wine's appealing bouquet. Subdued tropical-fruit flavors, mineral notes and a buttery, elegant mouthfeel with good acidity follow. The lengthy finish shows lingering, complex fruit flavors.\n27429\tAustralia\t\t91\t17\tWestern Australia\tGreat Southern\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRobert Oatley 2012 Riesling (Great Southern)\tRiesling\tRobert Oatley\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a bit rounder and richer than many Australian Rieslings, with pronounced weight and rich texture on the palate. Instead of lime, it delivers orange blossom and orange sherbet notes that linger elegantly on the finish. Drink now�??2020.\n78023\tAustralia\tParadox\t91\t45\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2012 Paradox Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tYalumba\tGT_90_Points\tSourced from the northern Barossa, the name pays homage to the fact that this is not a stereotypical fruit bomb. Instead, it's a savory, meaty wine featuring hints of cola and raspberry. Fermented with �??wild�?? yeasts in open-top vats and matured largely in used French oak puncheons (500 liters), this is a balanced, medium-bodied red well suited to the dinner table.\n90740\tAustralia\tThe Lucky Lizard\t91\t35\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2008 The Lucky Lizard Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tAlthough d'Arenberg is better known as a source of hearty McLaren Vale red wines, this tautly balanced, wooded Chard leans toward pineapple and lime. Buttered, toasted hazelnuts add a polished, elegant note to the long, citrusy finish.\n90536\tAustralia\tGigglepot\t92\t49\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMollydooker 2014 Gigglepot Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tMollydooker\tGT_90_Points\tCreamy and plush may not be traditional Cabernet descriptors, but they're what this wine delivers. Vanilla and graham cracker notes swaddle mixed currant fruit in this big but cuddly teddy bear of a wine. Drink now�??2022.\n27428\tAustralia\t\t91\t29\tWestern Australia\tMount Barker\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPlantagenet 2009 Shiraz (Mount Barker)\tShiraz\tPlantagenet\tGT_90_Points\tDarker, sterner and less accessible than Plantagenet's Omrah bottling, the winery's flagship Shiraz offers substantial dark fruit flavors reminiscent of espresso, plum and cracked pepper. The tannins are firm, suggesting at least 2�??3 years of cellaring. (The 2007 is drinking well now.)\n37450\tAustralia\tReserve\t91\t45\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYering Station 2005 Reserve Chardonnay (Yarra Valley)\tChardonnay\tYering Station\tGT_90_Points\tAssertively toasty and nutty, this is barrel-fermented in new oak, but in 500-liter puncheons, not the smaller barriques, so that the wood doesn't overwhelm. Peach, vanilla and citrus flavors completely fill the mouth, yet remain fresh and vibrant on the finish. Drink now�??2012. Imported by Epic Wines.\n106717\tAustralia\tShotfire\t90\t23\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThorn Clarke 2013 Shotfire Cabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz (Barossa)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Shiraz\tThorn Clarke\tGT_90_Points\tFirmly tannic, this is the rare example of a lower-priced wine that deserves some time in the cellar. There's a sense of coolness and restraint to this wine at first. Hints of menthol lift scents of mixed berries, then develop on the palate into sturdy, chewy fruit flavors and mocha. Drink 2018�??2030.\n106725\tAustralia\t\t90\t40\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tVasse Felix 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Margaret River)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tVasse Felix\tGT_90_Points\tThis crisp, medium-bodied wine showcases Cabernet's hallmark cassis fruit. Sure, there are hints of cranberry, raspberry and cherry, but black currant defines this wine, running from start to finish. Dusty tannins swirl gently on the palate, combining with tart acidity to offer just the right amount of structure. Drink now�??2025.\n109427\tAustralia\tRare\t99\t300\tVictoria\tRutherglen\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChambers Rosewood Vineyards NV Rare Muscadelle (Rutherglen)\tMuscadelle\tChambers Rosewood Vineyards\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine is dark brown in hue with a greenish-gold tint to its rim, providing clues to its advanced age. The aromas are nutty, with mossy notes of rancio filled out by sweet flavors of dried dates and figs. It's full bodied and unctuous in texture, without being overblown or heavy on the palate. The intense finish lingers forever�??or at least until you give in and take another sip.\n23150\tAustralia\tPlexus Shiraz-Grenache-Mourv??dre\t90\t40\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJohn Duval Wines 2012 Plexus Shiraz-Grenache-Mourv??dre G-S-M (Barossa Valley)\tG-S-M\tJohn Duval Wines\tGT_90_Points\tLike all the Duval wines, this is amply structured.

This Clare Riesling starts with scents of talcum powder and lime sherbet, then follows those up with similar flavors. It's muscular and taut, even a bit austere, clocking in at only 11.4% alcohol. May develop through 2015.\n14680\tAustralia\tThe Ironstone Pressings Grenache-Shiraz-Mourv??dre\t92\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2008 The Ironstone Pressings Grenache-Shiraz-Mourv??dre Red (McLaren Vale)\tRh??ne-style Red Blend\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tThis Grenache-based blend derives considerable structure from its Shiraz (38%) and Mourv??dre (7%) components, giving it more firmness, length and ageability than might be expected. Dark chocolate and berry aromas and flavors pick up hints of dried tobacco and other herbs, ending on a crisp note. Give it two or three years, then drink it over the next 10�??12.\n116786\tAustralia\tReserve\t92\t30\tVictoria\tBendigo\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPassing Clouds 2005 Reserve Shiraz (Bendigo)\tShiraz\tPassing Clouds\tGT_90_Points\tLike the 2003, this is a big, no-holds-barred Shiraz. The 2005 is packed with cassis and blueberry fruit, framed by chocolate and vanilla notes and finishes with plenty of spicy complexity and some slightly rough tannins.

It's medium to full bodied, with a round, supple mouthfeel that ends in a wash of softly dusty tannins.\n23501\tAustralia\tMWC\t90\t15\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMcPherson Wine Company 2015 MWC Pinot Gris (Victoria)\tPinot Gris\tMcPherson Wine Company\tGT_90_Points\tMade with enough skin contact to yield a gentle coppery hue, this medium-bodied wine features aromas of cantaloupe, cherry and citrus. Cherry fruit on the palate is accompanied by vaguely Pinot Noir-like notes of dried bracken and moss, then glides to a long, silky finish. Drink now.\n118828\tAustralia\tThe Coppermine Road\t91\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2011 The Coppermine Road Cabernet Sauvignon (McLaren Vale)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tMedium-bodied, crisp and firmly tannic, this Cabernet still needs a few years to come into full bloom.

The 2005 Scotsdale Shiraz delivers layers of mixed berries, baking spices and hints of dried fruit and toasty oak. It's full-bodied, lush and creamy-textured in the mouth, with a long finish powered by fruit and shaped by dusty tannins.

Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tMitolo\tGT_90_Points\tA full-bodied, very ripe rendering of Shiraz, Mitolo's 2009 G.A.M. offers hints of raisined fruit to go with its notes of coffee, smoke, roasted meat and baking spices. The creamy midpalate and velvety finish make it drinkable already, although it should hold up well for another few years.\n37183\tAustralia\t\t91\t33\tSouth Australia\tPiccadilly Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPetaluma 2010 Chardonnay (Piccadilly Valley)\tChardonnay\tPetaluma\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a lush, ripe Chardonnay from a cool subregion of the Adelaide Hills.

It's full bodied and rich, with notes of plum and black cherries supported by hints of chocolate and vanilla. With its long, velvety finish, there's no reason to defer gratification, although it should drink well through at least 2020.\n22864\tAustralia\tOrphan Bank\t93\t69\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLangmeil 2013 Orphan Bank Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tLangmeil\tGT_90_Points\tAppropriately youthful and flashy, this is textbook Barossa Shiraz, full bodied and rich. Dusty tannins and mouthwatering acids support dark berry fruit, cedar and vanilla. It's drinkable now, but should add savoriness over the next 10 or more years.\n104382\tAustralia\tSingle Vineyard\t91\t25\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYangarra Estate Vineyard 2006 Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tYangarra Estate Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\tA unique blend of spice and blueberry sets this Shiraz apart from the pack, and it pulls away even further due to a lush, creamy texture and long, mouthcoating finish.

This shows aromatic red currants, bay leaf and sage on the nose, then folds in hints of cinnamon and brown sugar. The oak is in the background, letting the fruit carry the wine, yet building in a rich, velvety texture. Drink now�??2030.\n90522\tAustralia\tTwins\t92\t25\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMaverick 2014 Twins Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tMaverick\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a fine example of what Barossa Shiraz is capable of at a realistic price. It's full bodied and richly textured, plush without being too soft. French oak brings a smoky, bacony element to the ripe blueberry fruit, plus a dusting of baking spices that lingers on the finish. Drink now�??2025.\n2312\tAustralia\t\t90\t33\tWestern Australia\tPemberton\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPicardy 2006 Chardonnay (Pemberton)\tChardonnay\tPicardy\tGT_90_Points\tFrom a little-known region of Western Australia, this is a restrained, structured example of Chardonnay that may drink well for 5�??6 years. Subtle vanilla and bacon shadings upfront add nuance to the melon and pear aromas. Flavors are of soft, fully ripe tree fruit and melon, but held in check by citrusy notes and crisp acids.\n2587\tAustralia\tPoison Hill Vineyard\t90\t35\tWestern Australia\tFrankland River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFrankland Estate 2012 Poison Hill Vineyard Riesling (Frankland River)\tRiesling\tFrankland Estate\tGT_90_Points\tThe most aromatically complex of the FE 2012 Rieslings, the Poison Hill offers beguiling scents of tangerine sherbet and Earl Grey tea. It's almost too perfumy for its soft, medium-bodied structure and slightly dusty-textured finish, but those floral elements are also its appeal. Drink now�??2020+.\n64015\tAustralia\tSaign??e\t90\t20\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2006 Saign??e Ros?? (Barossa Valley)\tRos??\tTorbreck\tGT_90_Points\tAlthough not indicated on the label, this is 100% Mourv??dre, bone dry and barrel fermented. As a result, it's not your typical fresh and fruity ros??, showing instead dark, complex flavors of cola, chocolate tree bark and earth. Hints of strawberry lighten it somewhat, but this is almost more red than ros??.

Smoky notes from barrel fermentation emerge with air, accenting white nectarine and citrus fruit.

The complexity is almost overwhelming, as the aromas range from peppery spice and roasted meat to blueberry and tappanade. It's mouth filling and expansive, yet retains fine acids and just the right amount of slightly dusty tannins on the long finish. Approachable now, but capable of lasting at least though 2020.\n22317\tAustralia\t\t90\t36\tNew South Wales\tHunter Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBrokenwood 2013 Shiraz (Hunter Valley)\tShiraz\tBrokenwood\tGT_90_Points\tDespite being only medium bodied, this is a firmly tannic, structured wine. Subtle French oak scents of cedar and vanilla accent mixed berry fruit, while the finish is youthful, crisp and unyielding. This needs a minimum of two more years in the cellar.

Hints of celery leaf and apple accent tart citrus fruit, still mouthwateringly crisp. There's some richness on the palate, but hold through at least 2020 if you prefer mature notes of honey, marmalade and toast.\n44543\tAustralia\tSneaky\t90\t15\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKillibinbin 2013 Sneaky Shiraz (Langhorne Creek)\tShiraz\tKillibinbin\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a supple, creamy-textured Shiraz to enjoy through 2020.

Like most of the Yalumba wines, the oak levels have been pared back in recent vintages, allowing this wine's cassis fruit to to shine. Hints of tobacco, bay leaf and sage bring complexity, while the tannins are fine, adding a softly dusty feel to the long finish.\n84931\tAustralia\tParable\t90\t40\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tKilikanoon 2006 Parable Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tKilikanoon\tGT_90_Points\tA finely judged blend of fruity and savory, the 2006 Parable marries ripe plums with meaty elements as well as hints of coffee and vanilla.

There are enough hints of bright, raspberry-tinged fruit to warrant optimism about its aging trajectory, but at the moment it is dark, heavy and slightly scorched.

This is a big wine, marked by thick, chewy tannins on the finish, but they never obscure the flavors of grape skins, tapenade and mocha. Try after 2018.\n7297\tAustralia\tFamily Crest Grenache-Shiraz-Mourv??dre\t90\t21\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tAngove 2014 Family Crest Grenache-Shiraz-Mourv??dre Red (McLaren Vale)\tRh??ne-style Red Blend\tAngove\tGT_90_Points\tThe blend is 55% Grenache, 25% Shiraz and 20% Mourv??dre, but while this is a full-bodied wine, it's not overdone or bombastic. The masses of dark fruit are reined in by crisp acids and a layer of supple tannins, adding depth to the cassis, vanilla and mint flavors.

(McLaren Vale)\tRos??\tBeresford\tGT_90_Points\tThis is ripe, rich and even a touch tannic�??almost more of a light red than a true ros??. This makes it ideally suited to serve alongside summer's various grilled meats.

Notes of green peppercorns and pipe tobacco ease into raspberry fruit, made more complex through whole-bunch fermentation. The wine's silky texture is an added treat. This has the potential to be really interesting as it evolves through at least 2025.\n40919\tAustralia\t\t90\t16\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPeter Lehmann 2006 Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tPeter Lehmann\tGT_90_Points\tThis nicely balanced Barossa Shiraz shows that not all Barossa wines are overweight.

The palate is medium bodied, with a long line of focused acidity, herbs, an earthy core and a long cigar-box finish.\n33686\tAustralia\tMWC\t90\t\tVictoria\tVictoria\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMcPherson Wine Company 2014 MWC Pinot Noir (Victoria)\tPinot Noir\tMcPherson Wine Company\tGT_90_Points\tAt around $20 per bottle, this is a solid Pinot Noir for the money.

The palate is tangy and herbal while the powerful tannins are fine grained and the acidity well balanced. This should age rather nicely.

It's got those same wet stone and citrus tendencies and is made in the same medium-bodied, dry, high-acid style. There's a touch of pineapple as well, plus a long, dry crisp finish.\n25397\tAustralia\tThe Garden of Extraordinary Delights Single Vineyard\t94\t85\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2010 The Garden of Extraordinary Delights Single Vineyard Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tD'Arenberg\tGT_90_Points\tExtraordinarily delicious is more like it.

The 2014 Jackaman is so supple and easy to drink that it lacks a bit of the Cabernet austerity that makes the variety so attractive with red meats. Vanilla, dill and cassis notes finish softly dusty. This is very smooth and polished in texture, maybe too much so for me.\n58205\tAustralia\tCellar No. One Reserve\t91\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tChateau Reynella 2004 Cellar No. One Reserve Shiraz (McLaren Vale)\tShiraz\tChateau Reynella\tGT_90_Points\tLoaded with smoke, hickory and vanilla, this definitely shows plenty of oak, but there's also plenty of fruit to balance the ledger.

It's on the full-bodied side of the spectrum, with enough dusty tannins to suggest longevity through at least 2020, despite an already velvety finish.\n91326\tAustralia\t\t88\t27\tSouth Australia\tPadthaway\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tMorambro Creek 2014 Chardonnay (Padthaway)\tChardonnay\tMorambro Creek\tLT_90_Points\tScents of grilled peach and mango give this medium-bodied wine a tropical feel. It's creamy and lush on the palate, then adds a mouthwatering burst of citrus on the finish. Flavorful and satisfying.\n64577\tAustralia\tAss Kisser Fine Red Wine\t87\t10\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRocland Estate 2005 Ass Kisser Fine Red Wine Red (South Australia)\tRh??ne-style Red Blend\tRocland Estate\tLT_90_Points\tThe blend is 59% Shiraz, 41% Grenache in this medium-bodied, low-tannin red. The aromas are dark�??black cherry and plum�??but the flavors are redder and juicier, with raspberry notes backed by cinnamon and clove. The label may be a bit polarizing, but the wine inside is well made and a solid value.\n83968\tAustralia\t\t87\t18\tVictoria\tMornington Peninsula\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tT'Gallant 2000 Chardonnay (Mornington Peninsula)\tChardonnay\tT'Gallant\tLT_90_Points\tSeems almost Burgundian in this crowd, with its aromas of smoke and white peach and flavors of roasted hazelnuts and grilled peaches. Finishes clean and crisp, with tart, lime-like acidity and hints of smoke.\n83970\tAustralia\tHeytesbury\t87\t30\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tVasse Felix 2000 Heytesbury Chardonnay (Western Australia)\tChardonnay\tVasse Felix\tLT_90_Points\tThe aromas are so promising, redolent of toast and pears, butter and nectarines, that expectations are high. And make no mistake�??this is very good wine. It's just that a slightly resinous veneer of spicy oak largely dominates the palate and finish.\n107576\tAustralia\tGulf Station\t88\t20\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli 2008 Gulf Station Shiraz-Viognier (Yarra Valley)\tShiraz-Viognier\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a bit chunkier and less suave than De Bortoli's more expensive estate bottled Shiraz-Viognier, but it's still a very nice wine. Peppery spice marks the nose, while the flavors feature a nice blend of plum with savory notes of coffee and black olives. Drink now�??2015.\n107584\tAustralia\tShotfire\t88\t24\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tThorn Clarke 2008 Shotfire Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tThorn Clarke\tLT_90_Points\tThis medium- to full-bodied Shiraz features a welcoming mix of mulberries and vanilla, overtaken by cedary flavors on the finish, where the fruit turns crisp. A slab of charred steak would match the woody notes nicely. Drink now�??2013.\n6373\tAustralia\tEntity\t93\t40\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJohn Duval Wines 2012 Entity Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tJohn Duval Wines\tGT_90_Points\tThis is another top-flight example of how good the 2012 vintage was for South Australian Shiraz. The oak here is so subtle as to not factor into the wine's scents of raspberry and cracked pepper. Hints of spice and vanilla mark the palate, gently accenting red berry fruit before ending in a flood of silky tannins. Drink now�??2030.\n6648\tAustralia\tFrasca's Lane Vineyard\t90\t19\tVictoria\tKing Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tNugan Family Estates 2008 Frasca's Lane Vineyard Chardonnay (King Valley)\tChardonnay\tNugan Family Estates\tGT_90_Points\tLush and mouthfilling, this tropical-fruited Chard offers a ton of flavors at a surprisingly small price.

Still a baby, it currently shows lemon-lime characters, with kerosene and Barbie doll plastic. The palate is linear and supercitrusy.

Suitable as an ap??ritif or paired with slightly weighty fish dishes.\n110376\tAustralia\tWoodcutter's\t89\t18\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTorbreck 2013 Woodcutter's Semillon (Barossa Valley)\tS??millon\tTorbreck\tLT_90_Points\tThis style of Barossa Semillon is a far cry from that practiced in the Hunter Valley. This version is medium to full bodied, with waxy, pineapple notes and a crisp, linear finish that features just a hint of honey.

Potent cherry-berry fruit and ample spice (licorice, mocha and pepper) combine in a plump midpalate and linger on the velvety finish.\n83816\tAustralia\tBishop\t93\t37\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tGlaetzer 2013 Bishop Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tGlaetzer\tGT_90_Points\tThis has gone up in price over the years, but it's still a solid, relatively affordable example of Barossa Valley Shiraz. This is youthful and edgy, with meaty, savory notes accenting mixed berries and a hint of mint. The finish is a bit chewy right now, but mouthcoating and long.\n66656\tAustralia\tDB Family Selection Sparkling Brut\t88\t12\tNew South Wales\tRiverina\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tDe Bortoli NV DB Family Selection Sparkling Brut Sparkling (Riverina)\tSparkling Blend\tDe Bortoli\tLT_90_Points\tThis is straightforward, well-made tank-fermented fizz at a bargain price.

It's dry and medium-bodied, with a slightly oily, slightly coarse texture. Drink it young.\n28557\tAustralia\tThe Turk Semillon + Marsanne\t81\t14\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tTurkey Flat 2005 The Turk Semillon + Marsanne White (Barossa Valley)\tWhite Blend\tTurkey Flat\tLT_90_Points\tThis innovative blend of 60% S??millon and 40% Marsanne doesn't show the hoped-for synergies. Hints of tar and rubber refuse to blow off completely, and the modest green apple and citrus flavors come across as lean and emaciated on the palate.\n118603\tAustralia\tBlue Cow\t86\t19\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLongview 2006 Blue Cow Chardonnay (Adelaide Hills)\tChardonnay\tLongview\tLT_90_Points\tThis Chard comes down on the citrusy side of things, with just enough nectarine flavors to round out the more angular lemon and lime notes. It's medium-bodied, but boasts plenty of acidity to give it zest on the finish.\n112461\tAustralia\tThe Derelict Vineyard\t89\t29\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2007 The Derelict Vineyard Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose of this wine features some delicately lifted floral scents, but also darker notes of brandied cherries and asphalt. Give it some breathing time to let the tarry notes fade and allow the red cherry and cinnamon red-hot flavors to emerge. Finishes long, mouthwatering and just a touch warming. Drink now�??2014.\n112463\tAustralia\tPlaymates\t89\t22\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFetish 2008 Playmates Shiraz-Mourv??dre (Barossa)\tShiraz-Mourv??dre\tFetish\tLT_90_Points\tLeaving aside the suggestive name and packaging, this is a very soft, almost pillowy-tender 80% Shiraz blend, with a fair bit of complexity. It starts with scents of hickory, cedar and vanilla, adds plum and black cherry fruit, then hints at espresso and black olive on the finish. Drink now.\n65442\tAustralia\tSplit River\t86\t10\tWestern Australia\tWestern Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tEvans & Tate 2011 Split River Cabernet Sauvignon (Western Australia)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tEvans & Tate\tLT_90_Points\tThis bargain-priced offering boasts cool, restrained Cabernet aromas of cassis and mint, with just a touch of tomato creeping in. It's fairly weighty, with bold flavors of Ribena on the palate and soft tannins on the finish.

It's a fuller style than many Australian Rieslings, but pulls it off, packing in lemon-lime and honey notes. The finish is long and textured, just to the point of balanced bitterness. Ready to drink.\n112482\tAustralia\tThe Ironstone Pressings\t89\t65\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2007 The Ironstone Pressings G-S-M (McLaren Vale)\tG-S-M\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tThe Ironstone Pressings features enough rough edges at this stage to think it will benefit from a few years of cellaring. The tart cherry notes are angular, the tannins a bit chunky, but tea leaf and spice notes provide ample complexity. Try in 2013.\n46212\tAustralia\tPoacher's Blend\t87\t12\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSt Hallett 2006 Poacher's Blend Semillon-Sauvignon Blanc (Barossa)\tSemillon-Sauvignon Blanc\tSt Hallett\tLT_90_Points\tThere is 8g/L of residual sugar, so some tasters might object to a hint of sweetness, but others will just find it helps to accentuate the wine's fruit-forward nature. Pear and fig flavors pick up some honeyed stone fruit notes on the palate but this is nicely balanced and easy to drink.\n75134\tAustralia\t\t87\t65\tNew South Wales\tGundagai\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tEden Road 2010 Shiraz (Gundagai)\tShiraz\tEden Road\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a nicely constructed Shiraz with some cool-climate leanings.

(Barossa Valley)\tRos??\tSchwarz Wine Company\tLT_90_Points\tOnce past a distracting note of tire rubber, this ros?? of Grenache offers aromas of wet stone and watermelon rind. Berry fruit emerges on the palate, while the dry finish picks up hints of chocolate. Drink now, but maybe give it a quick splash into a decanter to see if that improves it.\n67485\tAustralia\tThe Feral Fox\t88\t32\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tD'Arenberg 2012 The Feral Fox Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Noir\tD'Arenberg\tLT_90_Points\tThe ample alcohol in this wine imparts a rich slightly syrupy feel to this wine that's not particularly Pinot-like, but still satisfying. Strawberry and raspberry notes carry a hint of tomato leaf, then finish with crisp acids.\n129446\tAustralia\t3 Sisters & A Brother\t87\t17\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\t\t\tMoorooroo 2015 3 Sisters & A Brother Shiraz (Barossa Valley)\tShiraz\tMoorooroo\tLT_90_Points\tBlack licorice, raisiny fruit and a little sweaty oak are the name of the game here. Acidity on the palate is searing and tannins are soft, not giving quite enough support. The fruit is on the sour side and the oak a little bitter.\n87768\tAustralia\tPrickly\t88\t11\tVictoria\tAlpine Valleys\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tFrisk 2014 Prickly Riesling (Alpine Valleys)\tRiesling\tFrisk\tLT_90_Points\tLight, off-dry and refreshing, this would make an ideal poolside sipper.

It's medium in body and rather lean, with a crisp, fully dry finish. The blend is 69% Sauvignon Blanc, 31% Semillon.\n118122\tAustralia\tThe Broad-side\t88\t17\tSouth Australia\tLanghorne Creek\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBleasdale 2014 The Broad-side Red (Langhorne Creek)\tRed Blend\tBleasdale\tLT_90_Points\tShiraz (60%), Cabernet Sauvignon (28%) and Malbec (12%) combine in this medium-bodied silky-textured blend. Hints of eucalyptus linger around the margins, while the core of the wine features raspberry and cherry fruit.

Cedary, gently sawdusty notes and a touch of nail polish are apparent on the nose, while the palate is admirably full bodied and richly textured. The finish is generally velvety, but also shows hints of varnish or paint thinner. Overall, the raw materials are impressive, but the wine comes across as a bit disjointed.\n120175\tAustralia\t\t84\t10\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tOxford Landing 2007 Merlot (South Australia)\tMerlot\tOxford Landing\tLT_90_Points\tSmoky, pungent and earthy, with cola and plum notes that fill the mouth, then turn crisp on the finish.\n79675\tAustralia\tSingle Vineyard\t83\t13\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYangarra Estate Vineyard 2006 Single Vineyard Chardonnay (McLaren Vale)\tChardonnay\tYangarra Estate Vineyard\tLT_90_Points\tSweet corn, melon and citrus flavors coat the mouth, leaving a slightly oily impression.\n15764\tAustralia\tWhippet\t88\t18\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tLongview 2007 Whippet Sauvignon Blanc (Adelaide Hills)\tSauvignon Blanc\tLongview\tLT_90_Points\tThis crisp, focused wine may not be quite as racy as its namesake dog breed, but it is very fresh.

A green peppercorn note accents red raspberry and cherry fruit, with just a hint of vanilla in the background. Drink it over the next year or two.\n60764\tAustralia\t\t89\t23\tSouth Australia\tKangaroo Island\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHazyblur 2010 Pinot Gris (Kangaroo Island)\tPinot Gris\tHazyblur\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine almost quivers with freshness when first sniffed, it's so vibrant and citrusy.

Dark fruit aromas and flavors of blueberry, blackberry and plum are accented by hints of dried spices and pepper.

Hints of mint mark the nose and the palate, but the core is cassis, framed by touches of vanilla. Firm tannins on the finish suggest cellaring through at least 2010.\n64984\tAustralia\tReserve\t85\t13\tSouth Australia\tAdelaide Hills\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tJacob's Creek 2013 Reserve Pinot Noir (Adelaide Hills)\tPinot Noir\tJacob's Creek\tLT_90_Points\tFor the price, this is a remarkable achievement. It's a varietally correct, properly lightweight Pinot Noir imbued with attractive black cherry fruit. There's a charred-stave character that adds vanilla and a tinge of mocha as well.

Not sure if this will ever completely integrate, so the best bet seems to be drinking earlier rather than later.\n67056\tAustralia\t\t87\t20\tWestern Australia\tMargaret River\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCape Mentelle 2015 Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon (Margaret River)\tSauvignon Blanc-Semillon\tCape Mentelle\tLT_90_Points\tThis nearly 50-50 blend is restrained and grassy, reflecting the French ownership and philosophy well. Grapefruit and cut grass will marry well with food or be pleasant on its own, even picking up a hint of stoniness on the fully dry finish.\n30442\tAustralia\t\t87\t60\tVictoria\tYarra Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYeringberg 2014 Viognier (Yarra Valley)\tViognier\tYeringberg\tLT_90_Points\tThis wine has a creamy texture on the palate, but the flavors don't match that level of ripeness. Pink grapefruit, nettles and cut grass are more Sauvignon Blanc-like than Viognier. There's even a hint of garden pea on the warm finish.\n62916\tAustralia\t\t87\t10\tAustralia Other\tSouth Eastern Australia\t\t\t\tRosemount 2003 Riesling (South Eastern Australia)\tRiesling\tRosemount\tLT_90_Points\tLight floral and honeysuckle aromas are very pretty and compelling, as is the wine's citrus-laden palate. What an introduction to the variety�??it's a good value, it's correct, and it's dry. Worth keeping a few bottles around the house.\n62918\tAustralia\tOld Vine\t87\t18\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\t\t\tSimon Hackett 2002 Old Vine Grenache (McLaren Vale)\tGrenache\tSimon Hackett\tLT_90_Points\tBright, bouncy cherry and plum aromas; wood and earth are interspersed with mixed cherries on the palate.

Drink now.\n81043\tAustralia\t1850 Old Vine\t89\t80\tSouth Australia\tBarossa Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tCirillo 2005 1850 Old Vine Grenache (Barossa Valley)\tGrenache\tCirillo\tLT_90_Points\tAs might be expected, this has some familial similarities with the 2004 version (also reviewed this issue). It's full-bodied and dark-fruited, but the acids are brighter and the mouthfeel less luxurious, ending on a crisp note. Give it another year or two in the bottle to see if it develops more lushness.\n81053\tAustralia\tOld Bushvine\t89\t17\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tReilly's 2005 Old Bushvine Grenache (Clare Valley)\tGrenache\tReilly's\tLT_90_Points\tGrenache isn't as common in the Clare Valley as it is in Barossa or McLaren Vale, but Reilly's is a consistent source. The 2005 is dense and chocolaty, packed with plum flavors that are on the edge of prune and featuring a touch of warmth on the long, fudge-like finish.

This features some hints of honey and toast on the nose, followed by notes of citrus and almond. It's round and mouthfilling on the palate, but falls away a bit quickly on the finish.\n23805\tAustralia\tPatchwork\t89\t19\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tYalumba 2013 Patchwork Shiraz (Barossa)\tShiraz\tYalumba\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a reliable bottling for lovers of Barossa Shiraz who don't want to drop more than a Jackson.

This aged white might be just the thing. Scents of grape skins and honey waft from the glass, followed by flavors akin to honey, beeswax and bitter almond.

Then the palate turns dark and savory, adding hints of espresso, olive and asphalt. Try it in 2017, by which time it should've settled down and become more integrated.\n116353\tAustralia\tPolish Hill River\t85\t\tSouth Australia\tClare Valley\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tPauletts 2010 Polish Hill River Riesling (Clare Valley)\tRiesling\tPauletts\tLT_90_Points\tHas typical Clare Valley Riesling elements of crushed stone and citrus, but also considerable petrol and hints of honey and ripe apple.

The 2015 is 92% Grenche, with the balance a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Dolcetto and Mataro. Crushed stone and red berry scents lead the way, followed by flavors that are reminiscent of white chocolate and strawberries. It's fairly weighty for a ros??, with a long, slightly viscous finish.\n5301\tAustralia\t\t88\t10\tAustralia Other\tCentral Ranges\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tRolling 2009 Shiraz (Central Ranges)\tShiraz\tRolling\tLT_90_Points\tDespite the inexpensive price tag, this is a solid Shiraz, offering ripe black cherry fruit and touches of tree bark and orris root.

The 2004 shows a fair amount of complexity allied to firm tannins and crisp acids, and will probably require another 4�??5 years to show its best.\n59600\tAustralia\tGiles\t86\t67\tSouth Australia\tLenswood\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tHenschke 2010 Giles Pinot Noir (Lenswood)\tPinot Noir\tHenschke\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a crisp, tart and somewhat ungenerous example of Australian Pinot Noir. It's lean and wiry, with a solid sinew of pie-cherry fruit, so maybe it just needs time, as it seems otherwise well made.\n111390\tAustralia\tThe Loose Cannon\t86\t16\tSouth Australia\tMcLaren Vale\t\t\t\tHugh Hamilton 2007 The Loose Cannon Viognier (McLaren Vale)\tViognier\tHugh Hamilton\tLT_90_Points\tPeaches and white flowers make for a very seductive first act.

The result seems a touch off-dry, although the actual residual sugar is only 3.5 g/L. Despite being lightweight in the mouth, it turns a bit honeyed and weightier on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.\n14933\tAustralia\tGamekeeper's Shiraz-Grenache-Touriga\t86\t13\tSouth Australia\tBarossa\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tSt Hallett 2008 Gamekeeper's Shiraz-Grenache-Touriga Red (Barossa)\tRed Blend\tSt Hallett\tLT_90_Points\tFresh and juicy, this easy-drinking blend provides simple mint and cassis aromas and flavors at a reasonable price, with just enough structure to stand up to burgers and the like.

This is a fine, crisp wine for early drinking. Lacy floral and cherry aromas lead the way, followed by tart flavors reminiscent of berry zinger tea.\n123147\tAustralia\tSteeple Jack\t84\t7\tSouth Australia\tSouth Australia\t\tJoe Czerwinski\t@JoeCz\tBallast Stone Estate Wines 2006 Steeple Jack Merlot (South Australia)\tMerlot\tBallast Stone Estate Wines\tLT_90_Points\tFor the price, this is a commendable effort, with scents of toast and vanilla layered over modest cherry fruit.

The mouthfeel is big, but very easy, even soft; with a little more spine-acidity and tannins-this wine could merit a higher score.

Still gritty in its youth, it shows a soft and delicate nature at its core, accented in rose petal and a persistent streak of minerality complemented by a richness of deep dark red cherry.\n15734\tUS\tRiverview Vineyard Estate Grown\t91\t35\tCalifornia\tMonterey\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tMetz Road 2015 Riverview Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Monterey)\tPinot Noir\tMetz Road\tGT_90_Points\tThis bottling from the Scheid family, one of the region's largest growers, shows aromas of baked red cherry in a vanilla pie crust as well as marjoram, bay leaf and cinnamon.

This is an incredible wine, as always, but particularly soft and structured in this fine vintage, which deftly marries pretty aromatics and zippy acidity with darker, stormier elements of ripe fig and wood smoke. There's so much complexity and life going on, it'll be hard to wait on this one, though more time in the bottle should make everything that much more settled and complete. Drink now through 2023.\n62528\tUS\t\t90\t40\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tWesMar 2013 Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley)\tPinot Noir\tWesMar\tGT_90_Points\tCrisp red cherry and a taste of grenadine characterize this light, bright wine, with accents of orange and rhubarb.

It's nowhere near ready, even if you're used to tannins in your reds. It's hard as nails in astringency. This 2006 vintage doesn't have quite the concentration of the �??05, but there are some lovely black cherry and black currant flavors, and they should begin to blossom in 4 or 5 years.\n12115\tUS\t\t90\t30\tCalifornia\tDry Creek Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tRodney Strong 2014 Zinfandel (Dry Creek Valley)\tZinfandel\tRodney Strong\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine's restrained aromas take time to come around, showing a mix of dust and black pepper before waves of juicy red fruit and soft tannin and oak mingle together seamlessly on the palate.

This wine does the site justice, a smooth concoction of cherry pit and allspice, elegant and yet plenty generous in fruit and structure, measured by natural acidity.\n56892\tUS\tAvansino Grand Reserve\t92\t28\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tArbor Crest 2012 Avansino Grand Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon (Columbia Valley (WA))\tCabernet Sauvignon\tArbor Crest\tGT_90_Points\tThis is the first vintage for this blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Sangiovese. Ripe, lush and complex, it offers flavors of plum and cassis, with an appealing texture and moderately gripping tannins. There's life and snap to the finish, and though it's already delicious just two years after the vintage, another year or two of bottle age should see it continue to improve.\n117870\tUS\t\t93\t55\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tFrazier 2008 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tFrazier\tGT_90_Points\tThe vintage was kind to Frazier, whose red wines excelled in 2008. This Cabernet Sauvignon, made by Kirk Venge, is classic Napa Valley. It's dry, richly textured in tannins, and complex, offering intense waves of blackberries, black currants, cr??me de cassis and oak. Yes, the alcohol is high, but who's counting? As good as it is now, it should develop bottle complexity over the next 4�??6 years.\n118094\tUS\tReserve Collection\t93\t26\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tRuby Hill Winery 2014 Reserve Collection Chardonnay (Livermore Valley)\tChardonnay\tRuby Hill Winery\tGT_90_Points\tRich and spicy, full-bodied but gentle, this wine oozes ripe pear, vanilla, fig and hazelnut from the nose to the palate to the lingering finish.

It's densely concentrated on the palate, but brisk acidity and glimmers of violet, lavender and graphite lend levity and freshness. Approachable already yet regal with fine firm tannins, it's ready to drink now but should continue to improve for at least another decade.\n38729\tUS\tThree Legged\t90\t19\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

Big fruit, organically grown, runs right through the core, a mix of berries, cherries and plums; woven into the fruit is a lightly leafy vein, a whiff of tobacco, and a suggestion of earthy, organic compost. Thoroughly delicious.\n75348\tUS\t\t91\t27\tCalifornia\tDry Creek Valley\tSonoma\t\t\tKokomo 2007 Petite Sirah (Dry Creek Valley)\tPetite Sirah\tKokomo\tGT_90_Points\tThe Yiddish word �??zaftig�?? perfectly describes this Petite Sirah. It's big, powerful and fleshy, with potent flavors of blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, dark chocolate, licorice, bacon and peppery spices, all wrapped into significant tannins. A very nice example of the variety, it's dry and balanced, and should age for years.\n79377\tUS\tBrut Cuve??\t90\t42\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tLongboard NV Brut Cuve??

Twists of dried cranberry and blueberry provide the fruity components, which are nuanced compared with the big hits of black and white pepper.\n57122\tUS\t\t90\t18\tWashington\tYakima Valley\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tKevin White 2014 Red (Yakima Valley)\tRh??ne-style Red Blend\tKevin White\tGT_90_Points\tA new offering from this young winery, this wine is mostly Syrah (54%) with the rest equal parts Grenache and Mourv??dre.

Ponzi does, and the result is a terrific vintage for Tavola. Bright, compact, aromatic and lushly fruited with plum and black cherry, this is a stunning value.

It offers black tea, truffle and forest floor, the body sinewy and complex. Savory in cinnamon and clove on the finish, it needs more time to open; decant or cellar through 2021.\n62778\tUS\t\t91\t28\tCalifornia\tSanta Barbara County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tSolminer 2014 Riesling (Santa Barbara County)\tRiesling\tSolminer\tGT_90_Points\tRipe aromas of honeydew are cut down the middle with a pointed petrol note as well as lime skins and grapefruit pith. The palate on this bottling from popular Riesling source Kick-On Ranch is wound up very tight, showing lime skins, focused acidity and a gray-rock minerality. This would go great with shellfish now, or continue to emerge and uncurl in the cellar from 2018�??2030.\n38730\tUS\tAmante\t90\t50\tCalifornia\tTemecula Valley\tSouth Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tFalkner 2012 Amante Red (Temecula Valley)\tRed Blend\tFalkner\tGT_90_Points\tItalian varietals can excel in this SoCal zone, and this Sangiovese-led Super Tuscan blend is a prime example, with crushed graphite, tobacco, juicy blackberry and woodpile notes on the nose.

But it's nowhere near ready to drink now. Erupts with ripe, juicy blackberries, black cherries, minerals and sweet cassis. The grapes are from the Pope Valley region. Very big, bold and dramatic, but immature. Hold for a good six years.\n24205\tUS\tRos?? of\t90\t19\tCalifornia\tSan Benito County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tLe P'tit Paysan 2013 Ros?? of Mourv??dre (San Benito County)\tMourv??dre\tLe P'tit Paysan\tGT_90_Points\tVenturing into the orange side of the ros?? color rainbow, this Mourv??dre-based wine�??with 13% Grenache�??brings melon, guava, pomelo and ripening banana to the nose, followed by papaya and watermelon once sipped.

Jenkins sits above the fog line and is rich in Goldridge soils. The wine is lightly mushroomy in earth, and a keen streak of exotic spiciness kicks in convincingly on the finish, after intense and complicated layers of red cherry, raspberry and lavender.\n24207\tUS\tRos??\t90\t19\tCalifornia\tYolo County\tCentral Valley\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tMidsummer Cellars 2013 Ros?? Grenache (Yolo County)\tGrenache\tMidsummer Cellars\tGT_90_Points\tMade from 88% Grenache and 12% Viognier, this lilting wine abounds with dry, fruity and floral characteristics. Salmon-peach in color, it has texture and the requisite refreshment offered by its barely ripe strawberry and peach swathes.

With 147 g/L of residual sugar, it still reaches over 12% alcohol. Pineapple, lemon and orange peel, pine resin, honey, cedar and butterscotch are all in the mix, plus a lot more.

It was aged in 65% new French oak for 16 months. It's open and generous, offering bright berry, cherry and red currant fruit matched to defining acids, all set in a fine-tuned frame of new oak.

Exceptionally ripe in grapefruit, lime and gooseberry fruit, it shows the minerality of this vineyard that gives the wine grip and grounding. Bone-dry, with crisp supportive acidity and just the right amount of oak, it's wonderful now.

The black-currant flavor is strong and deep; the tannins are thick and dramatic; and the acidity is fresh and stimulating.

Based on Cabernet Franc, the wine's flavors are simply delicious, offering waves of cherries, blueberries, plums and currants. Plenty of new oak adds toasty vanilla. Those tannins suggest pairing this wine with rich foods, such as lamb, but you don't want to smother the delicacy underneath a rustic stew.

A blend of Mourv??dre (51%), Cinsault (27%), Grenache (18%) and Counoise, it leads with fragrant aromas of crushed flowers, thyme, smoke, white pepper and boysenberry.

It might be mistaken for Chardonnay, except for the extra weight that carries through the lengthy finish. Though it's tempting to describe white Pinot Noirs as sparkling wines without the sparkle, this is much more interesting, and one of the rare examples that defines both a style and a standard for the rest.\n106343\tUS\t\t91\t40\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tSequoia Grove 2012 Syrah (Napa Valley)\tSyrah\tSequoia Grove\tGT_90_Points\tA sizable percentage of Cabernet Franc (19%) makes it into this wine, as does 1% Viognier.

Stylistically somewhat unique for Washington, it brings brooding aromas of sauvage, herb, smoked meat and white pepper, along with a bit of reduction.

Pure blackberries and black cherries show on the brooding nose, with touches of mint and licorice. The palate is soft on entry, then come boisterous flavors of black currant and blueberry.

There is a rustic and gamy quality to the dark berry-laced palate, with meat, leather and spice qualities, lifted by a touch of licorice.\n79641\tUS\tGraceful Lady Maggy Hawk Estate Vineyard Clone 777\t91\t66\tCalifornia\tAnderson Valley\t\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tMaggy Hawk 2014 Graceful Lady Maggy Hawk Estate Vineyard Clone 777 Pinot Noir (Anderson Valley)\tPinot Noir\tMaggy Hawk\tGT_90_Points\tConcentrated fruit, spice and black-tea flavors lend a sense of depth on the palate and make this full-bodied wine satisfying to sip.

Aromas of fresh-cut apple and green papaya meet with a very stony minerality on the nose. The palate's powerful texture and sizzling acidity carry riper flavors of Gala apple and Anjou pear that continue deep into the finish.\n56910\tUS\tNielson Vineyard\t91\t38\tCalifornia\tSanta Maria Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tKen Brown 2012 Nielson Vineyard Chardonnay (Santa Maria Valley)\tChardonnay\tKen Brown\tGT_90_Points\tMade from grapes grown in Santa Barbara County's oldest commercial vineyard, one of the region's winemaking pioneers presents aromas of citrusy meringue atop a core of toasting wood.

A juicy core of broad plum, dark cherry and pomegranate wrap seamlessly around a fresh streak of minerality and rich texture.\n12133\tUS\tReserve\t90\t55\tCalifornia\tLivermore Valley\tCentral Coast\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tCuda Ridge Wines 2013 Reserve Malbec (Livermore Valley)\tMalbec\tCuda Ridge Wines\tGT_90_Points\tThis wine tastes concentrated and powerful, from the first whiff of spicy cedar and black pepper to the smoky, dried fruit flavors and mouth-coating texture. It owes its savory, smoky character to its exceptionally long 30-month oak ageing. Yet while bold and assertive, its alcohol is restrained.\n12138\tUS\tNelson Vineyard\t90\t18\tCalifornia\tDry Creek Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tDraxton 2016 Nelson Vineyard Sauvignon Blanc (Dry Creek Valley)\tSauvignon Blanc\tDraxton\tGT_90_Points\tCreamy in mouthfeel and spicy with acidity, this is a well-heeled, lightly crafted wine with integrated crispness and peach and lemon highlights.\n107642\tUS\tPlus One Kiona Vineyard\t90\t75\tWashington\tRed Mountain\tColumbia Valley\tSean P. Sullivan\t@wawinereport\tRasa 2014 Plus One Kiona Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Mountain)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tRasa\tGT_90_Points\tAlthough it's 100% varietal and comes from one of the state's oldest Cabernet vineyards, this wine is somewhat blue-fruited for the variety, with notes of plum and mountain blueberry along with herb, graphite, espresso and spice. The palate shows more of the same, bringing a sense of restraint and polish along with lightly grainy tannins that need some time to stretch their legs. It doesn't scream Cabernet but it still brings plenty of appeal. Best after 2022.\n107645\tUS\t\t90\t39\tCalifornia\tSanta Cruz Mountains\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tSante Arcangeli 2015 Pinot Noir (Santa Cruz Mountains)\tPinot Noir\tSante Arcangeli\tGT_90_Points\tA blend of three vineyards, located between Corralitos and the Summit area, this bottling conveys rusty, earthy cranberries, cherries and Earl Grey tea on the nose. The earthy character also shows on the sip, where animal hide, sour cranberry, red plum, rose petal and pine-forest flavors converge.\n64886\tUS\tMeritage\t91\t25\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tHestia Cellars 2007 Meritage Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tHestia Cellars\tGT_90_Points\tThis Meritage red is 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Cabernet Franc, and 15% Petit Verdot. There are noticeable high toned aromas hinting at nail polish. The fruit is bright cherry and darker black currant, with milk chocolate coating the finish. The wine is still tightly wound and opens very slowly, so decanting is recommended.\n120391\tUS\tRoger Rose Vineyard\t91\t2013\tCalifornia\tArroyo Seco\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tBlair 2013 Roger Rose Vineyard Chardonnay (Arroyo Seco)\tChardonnay\tBlair\tGT_90_Points\tThe nose on this single-vineyard wine from a strong, often overlooked appellation is tight and minerally before showing a slightly tropical kiwi element. Brightly acidic on the lively palate, flavors range from Key lime and Meyer lemon to pear skins and apple flesh.\n120392\tUS\til Grande Gallo\t91\t43\tCalifornia\tSanta Ynez Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tCarhartt Vineyard 2012 il Grande Gallo Red (Santa Ynez Valley)\tRed Blend\tCarhartt Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a meticulously crafted blend of 50% Sangiovese, 24% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Petit Verdot from four vineyards spread throughout the appellation. Soft and plush, the nose shows dried strawberries, pork fat and a touch of black truffle. The hedonistic palate offers dried cherries, warm fudge and chewy tannins.\n56914\tUS\tFarrah\t91\t20\tCalifornia\tLodi\tCentral Valley\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tKlinker Brick 2012 Farrah Syrah (Lodi)\tSyrah\tKlinker Brick\tGT_90_Points\tRich and meaty enough to sink your teeth into, this dark and deep Syrah has toasty, smoky aromas. Generous blackberry and boysenberry flavors that are full but not sweet accompany a velvety texture. This is tasty now, but has the layered tannins and acidity for aging. Best now through 2019.\n56915\tUS\tWhite4\t91\t16\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tVina Robles 2013 White4 White (Paso Robles)\tWhite Blend\tVina Robles\tGT_90_Points\tFresh-squeezed apple juice, grapefruit spritzer and nearly sweet cherry aromas sit atop minerality on the nose of this blend of 46% Viognier, 19% Verdelho, 19% Vermentino and 16% Sauvignon Blanc. There's a lot of tart acidity, with a lingering apple flavor.\n57213\tUS\tAroha Vineyard\t90\t32\tOregon\tUmpqua Valley\tSouthern Oregon\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tIris Vineyards 2014 Aroha Vineyard Pinot Noir (Umpqua Valley)\tPinot Noir\tIris Vineyards\tGT_90_Points\tJust a couple of barrels were produced of this vineyard-designate. Tasting of lush strawberry preserves, it's nicely focused, slightly peppery, and offers skin flavors as well as fleshy fruit. Sweet barrel spices carry a hint of clove, and round off a big, delicious finish.\n11868\tUS\tBouchet\t90\t35\tCalifornia\tCentral Coast\t\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tBrander 2015 Bouchet Red\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tBrander\tGT_90_Points\tBlack cherry pie, milk chocolate and lilacs combine for a very accessible and rather lavish nose on this blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. It's easy to like on the sip, with candied purple fruit and licorice spice flavors, proving very fruity, lush and quaffable.\n113819\tUS\tSolesce Red Wine\t90\t58\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tBrian Carter Cellars 2004 Solesce Red Wine Red (Columbia Valley (WA))\tRed Blend\tBrian Carter Cellars\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a barrel selection, from those lots determined by winemaker Brian Carter to offer more aging potential. In other words, it's a L'Etalon reserve, fragrant and offering scents and flavors of strawberry jam, berries galore, and fine-tuned acids and tannins.\n114048\tUS\tTondre Grapefield\t90\t\tCalifornia\tSanta Lucia Highlands\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tTestarossa 2015 Tondre Grapefield Chardonnay (Santa Lucia Highlands)\tChardonnay\tTestarossa\tGT_90_Points\tLemongrass, honeysuckle, Gala apple and light caramel show on the riper nose of this bottling from the Los Gatos-based winery. Every-so-slight marshmallow flavors rise on the palate alongside jasmine and wet riverstone. The texture is chalky.\n28604\tUS\tPalisades Vineyard\t90\t65\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tClos Pegase 2003 Palisades Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tClos Pegase\tGT_90_Points\tThe estate vineyard is in Calistoga, and the wine shows gorgeously ripe flavors but never loses its basic Napa elegance and balance. Filled with flamboyant blackberry jam, cherry, cassis, licorice, chocolate and smoky vanilla-oak flavors, it appeals immediately to the tastebuds, but has the tannin-acid balance to age for a decade.\n28607\tUS\t\t90\t15\tCalifornia\tAmador County\tSierra Foothills\t\t\tEaston 2006 Zinfandel (Amador County)\tZinfandel\tEaston\tGT_90_Points\tEaston's basic Zin offers plenty of delicious pleasure. It's a dry, smoothly tannic wine, packed with wild blackberry, mulberry, mocha and (believe it or not) ollallieberry flavors, which perhaps suggests a certain rural, old-fashioned quality. The wine is also superspicy in white pepper and nutmeg. Great value.\n91853\tUS\t\t95\t36\tCalifornia\tRussian River Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tLimerick Lane 2013 Syrah-Grenache (Russian River Valley)\tSyrah-Grenache\tLimerick Lane\tGT_90_Points\tMade from 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache, this deceptively restrained wine shows a silkiness of texture wrapped around a brightness of soft, red berry and earth, managing to stay juicy and refreshing in the glass. Leather and black pepper play on the palate as it winds down.\n91340\tUS\tDurell Vineyard Hayfield Block\t91\t48\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tSaxon Brown 2012 Durell Vineyard Hayfield Block Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\tPinot Noir\tSaxon Brown\tGT_90_Points\tThe dark garnet color seems right for a wine that smells like black cherries and black-skinned plums, and tastes deep and rich. Both the flavors and the texture seem shaped by subtly spicy oak. Fine-grained tannins add a velvety touch and the finish lingers.\n91343\tUS\t\t91\t25\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tTreos 2014 Albari?�o (Willamette Valley)\tAlbari?�o\tTreos\tGT_90_Points\tAlbari?�o is rare enough in Oregon, but virtually unknown in the Willamette Valley. This estate-grown wine, from a vineyard in the valley's southwest corner, makes a solid case for more. Tart and tangy with brightly defined flavors of grapefruit, apple and pineapple, this is deliciously bracing. There's nothing simple about it; the flavors extend and expand through a wonderfully long finish.\n57215\tUS\tLacrima d'Oro\t90\t35\tOregon\tWillamette Valley\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tApolloni 2014 Lacrima d'Oro Muscat (Willamette Valley)\tMuscat\tApolloni\tGT_90_Points\tPicked at 33 brix and fermented in new French oak, this heavy, almost oily dessert wine has a floral aroma as intense as bottled perfume. Flavors suggest orange liqueur, honey and candied apricots. It pulls together just enough acidity to avoid falling into a fat, cloying finish.\n56457\tUS\tState Lane Vineyard\t91\t58\tCalifornia\tYountville\tNapa\t\t\tCorley 2004 State Lane Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Yountville)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tCorley\tGT_90_Points\tAll the parts of this juvenile wine have not begun to come together. You have ripe, jammy blackberry, cassis and blueberry flavors, firm tannins, evident new oak, and crisp acidity. All they need is time to marry. The wine is 100% Cabernet, and the grapes used to be vineyard-designated by Beringer. Cellar until at least late 2008, and the wine should improve for many years.\n114050\tUS\tEye of the Toad Dry Ros?? of\t90\t14\tCalifornia\tSonoma County\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tToad Hollow 2016 Eye of the Toad Dry Ros?? of Pinot Noir (Sonoma County)\tPinot Noir\tToad Hollow\tGT_90_Points\tCandied cherry and tangerine are welcome flavors in this crisp, dry and exceptionally light and easy-drinking wine.

The acidity is evened out on the sip, making for a subtle and pleasant experience full of dried grass, light citrus and Granny Smith apple skin flavors.\n60941\tUS\tSori Bricco Vineyard\t93\t80\tCalifornia\tDiamond Mountain District\tNapa\t\t\tVon Strasser 2007 Sori Bricco Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Diamond Mountain District)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tVon Strasser\tGT_90_Points\tA beautifully rich, complex mountain wine that wants some time in the cellar. Dry and complex in tannin structure, it shows flamboyant blackberry, cherry, raspberry, chocolate, roasted almond and brown sugar flavors, as delicious as a succulent granola candy bar. Already throwing some sediment, it's fine now and should develop at least through 2015.\n60944\tUS\t\t93\t45\tCalifornia\tSt. Helena\tNapa\t\t\tEhlers Estate 2007 Merlot (St. Helena)\tMerlot\tEhlers Estate\tGT_90_Points\tA spectacular Merlot that could help resurrect this variety's reputation. It's as complex as anything from Napa, but is softer and more accessible than a Cabernet Sauvignon, which constitutes 8% of the blend. Shows ripe flavors of red cherry pie filling, raspberries and cola, almost like a Pinot Noir, except for the black currants that must come from the Cab, and of course the tannins, which are rich and fine. Simply gorgeous and compelling. now�??2013.\n60946\tUS\tSierra Madre Vineyard\t93\t40\tCalifornia\tSanta Maria Valley\tCentral Coast\t\t\tByron 2008 Sierra Madre Vineyard Pinot Noir (Santa Maria Valley)\tPinot Noir\tByron\tGT_90_Points\tNotable for its soft texture, thoroughly ripe fruit, and richness of mouthfeel, which is what you want in Pinot Noir. It's not an ager, but so deliciously refined, you want to keep drinking.

It's a big, mouth filling wine whose tannins are considerable, and it will probably benefit from a year or two in the cellar. But it's so rich in blackberries, black currants and smoked meat that it's hard not to open it now. As sweet as the fruit is, the finish is thoroughly dry.\n91346\tUS\tThe Zin Cripple Creek Vineyard\t91\t34\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tWCP 2013 The Zin Cripple Creek Vineyard Zinfandel (Paso Robles)\tZinfandel\tWCP\tGT_90_Points\tA touch of smoked pork meets with red cherries, cola and black licorice on the nose of this small-batch wine out of Templeton by Will Persall.

The mouthfeel is lush, broad and quietly powerful, while subtle pear and marzipan flavors coat the palate and linger on the finish. It makes a grand impression and is �??meaty�?? enough to serve with poultry or even beef. Winemaker Tracy Hart used no oak or stainless steel, fermenting and aging the wine in food-grade polyethylene FlexTanks.\n105531\tUS\tM5\t92\t21\tCalifornia\tSanta Barbara County\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\t@mattkettmann\tMargerum 2016 M5 White (Santa Barbara County)\tRh??ne-style White Blend\tMargerum\tGT_90_Points\tThis blend of 48% Grenache Blanc, 14% Roussanne, 14% Viognier, 12% Marsanne and 12% Vermentino is one of the best and zippiest white Rh??ne-inspired blends on the market right now.

It's not a big, fat, blockbuster Pinot, but a leaner, more masculine style. The raspberry, cherry, red currant and sandalwood flavors should hold up well to the aging process. Now�??2013, at least.\n87525\tUS\tJack of Hearts Petit Verdot\t92\t50\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\t\t\tJada Vineyard & Winery 2010 Jack of Hearts Petit Verdot Cabernet Sauvignon (Paso Robles)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tJada Vineyard & Winery\tGT_90_Points\tThis is a huge wine, that's insanely rich and concentrated.

The estate vineyard is on Paso Robles' west side, and quite high in elevation in the southern spur of the Santa Lucia Mountains. The wine is ungainly now, and needs time to develop.

Rita Hills\tCentral Coast\t\t\tLongoria 2010 Fe Ciega Vineyard Pinot Noir (Sta. Rita Hills)\tPinot Noir\tLongoria\tGT_90_Points\tThe alcohol on this bottling is lower than most Fe Ciegas have been in the past, reflecting the cool vintage. The wine seems more austere than in the past, withholding a bit of the early appeal it used to show. Nonetheless, it's wonderfully structured in acids and tannins and very dry, with a judicious application of oak, and there are intricate flavors of cherries, red currants and herbs. Seems like it could shine with age, so give it six years in the cellar.\n87529\tUS\tGrenache-Cinsault\t92\t16\tCalifornia\tPaso Robles\tCentral Coast\t\t\tMinassian-Young 2011 Grenache-Cinsault Ros??

With this Grenache-Cinsault blend, Minassian-Young knocks it out of the park. The wine is dry, delicate, modest in alcohol, and complex, with subtle peach, rosehip tea, orange zest, watermelon and spice flavors. A great bargain, but only 64 cases were produced.\n87531\tUS\tCourtney's Vineyard\t92\t55\tCalifornia\tSta. Rita Hills\tCentral Coast\t\t\tTwo Sisters 2010 Courtney's Vineyard Chardonnay (Sta.

The flavors are higher in acidity, tart and puckering, with orange-peel flavors lingering on the finish.

The aromas are brooding and locked up at present with notes of mineral, black currant, spice, pencil lead and blackberry. The fruit flavors are black as night, supported by firm but exceptionally well-integrated tannins. It will be at its best from 2023 to 2031 but should last well beyond that.\n100209\tUS\tGrand Cheval Oregon\t92\t85\tOregon\tOregon\tOregon Other\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tDomaine Serene 2014 Grand Cheval Oregon Red (Oregon)\tRed Blend\tDomaine Serene\tGT_90_Points\tThis atypical blend brings exceptional fruit to the table, with Pinot Noir sourced from the Dundee Hills and Syrah from Walla Walla.

Along with the unctuous New World fruit, sap and flesh, there are thick, ripe tannins and a vivid acid underpinning. It drinks well right out of the bottle, the flavors beautifully wrapped together, mixing black fruits, black olives, herb and earth, smoke and coffee and toast.\n129927\tUS\t\t91\t28\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tTamarack Cellars 2006 Cabernet Franc (Columbia Valley (WA))\tCabernet Franc\tTamarack Cellars\tGT_90_Points\tIt's 100% Cabernet Franc, a delightful, bright and forward wine with sweet boysenberry and blueberry fruit. Behind the bright, luscious fruit flavors are chewy, earthy tannins. They are ripe and dry and give the wine weight and authority.

Oaky, in a Bordeaux manner, and very elegant.\n73043\tUS\t\t91\t50\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tAugust Briggs 1997 Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tAugust Briggs\tGT_90_Points\tDeep and sweet, but there's also an unusual and appetizing edge offered via cola nut and root beer.

In the mouth, flavors of black plums, mint-menthol and tobacco�??all with a foresty accent�??fill the palate. On the heavy side of medium-weight, with a supple texture, it has a long, toasty finish with fine tannins.

The wine also stands out for the richness of the oak, so perfectly integrated, and the overall balance. Beautiful acidity and thick, rich, supple tannins come along with a gorgeous, long, dry finish. The vineyard is in Yountville. You'll want to cellar this 100% Cab until at least 2020, and it could be going strong longer.\n15491\tUS\tLumi??re\t90\t30\tWashington\tColumbia Valley (WA)\tColumbia Valley\tSean P.

The tannins are hard and dramatic. As for the fruit, you can hardly find strong enough descriptors. It shows blackberry jam and black currants, cassis liqueur and minerals raised to fabulous mountain concentration. Violets and oak add to the equation. Somehow it all balances out, resulting in a wine of unusual grace and power. But it needs age. Drink 2019�??2031, if not beyond.\n3686\tUS\t\t91\t40\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tChasseur 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\tPinot Noir\tChasseur\tGT_90_Points\tFirm and substantial on the palate, this is a complex Pinot, the red cherry fruit juicy and inviting and the wine layered in Chinese five-spice.

This wine seems to be holding itself back, perhaps just in need of further cellaring, certainly requiring decanting. It's compact, elegant and well balanced, but shy. A pleasing streak of truffle elevates the finish.\n63255\tUS\t\t90\t40\tCalifornia\tRed Hills Lake County\t\tJim Gordon\t@gordone_cellars\tBoatique 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon (Red Hills Lake County)\tCabernet Sauvignon\tBoatique\tGT_90_Points\tSeductive, spicy oak in the aromas and flavors puts a great spin on this medium-bodied, velvety smooth wine from a promising new winery in Northern California.

It shows the pedigree and class you expect from a winery of Staglin's level, enormously rich in black currant, mocha and cedar flavors, with ripe, soft and complex tannins. But the price is challenging. If you choose to buy and cellar, the wine should develop at least for several years.\n129144\tUS\tRed Wine\t92\t65\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\t\t\tStephanie 2005 Red Wine Red (Napa Valley)\tBordeaux-style Red Blend\tStephanie\tGT_90_Points\tThis is the winery's priciest red and also its best. It immediately appeals for the soft, lush texture and the way the sweet fruit marries with the oak to wow the palate.

This wine is young and silky, supple and fruity and has some sharp acidity, but it doesn't overwhelm. It's the kind of wine that doesn't overshadow food. But it's excellent Pinot. The depth of flavor and long finish suggest aging possibilities, but there's no reason not to drink and enjoy it now.\n62514\tUS\t\t91\t36\tCalifornia\tSanta Cruz Mountains\tCentral Coast\t\t\tSavannah-Chanelle 1999 Zinfandel (Santa Cruz Mountains)\tZinfandel\tSavannah-Chanelle\tGT_90_Points\tGood Zins from this appellation are not common, which is too bad, considering how fine this one is. The fully ripened berry and spice fruit is married to intricate, lacy tannins, and the wine is dry.

It's one of the Willamette Valley's most distinctive and evocative sites, with less of an emphasis on pure fruit flavors, and more attention to details such as herbal tea, earth, stone and dried leaf. The fruit is tart and lightly herbal, like a fresh-picked mountain berry.\n114033\tUS\tEstate Reserve\t90\t40\tCalifornia\tNapa Valley\tNapa\tVirginie Boone\t@vboone\tLevendi 2015 Estate Reserve Chardonnay (Napa Valley)\tChardonnay\tLevendi\tGT_90_Points\tSalty brioche and pretzel bread come to mind first on the entry of this wine, both aromatically and on the palate.

It's rich in blackberries, black currants, cassis and minerals. Near- perfect tannins and a tasteful overlay of sweet oak add textural complexity. For all that, the wine feels young and brusque.

Cathy Corison makes her Cabs less ripe than many others, so the alcohol is lower and the acids and tannins are harder and drier. That's in youth. But such is the depth of cherry, blackberry, cassis, cedar and mineral flavors and overall balance that this complex young wine should easily negotiate the next 15 years.\n113820\tUS\t\t90\t23\tWashington\tWashington\tWashington Other\tPaul Gregutt\t@paulgwine?�\tCamaraderie 2004 Cabernet Franc (Washington)\tCabernet Franc\tCamaraderie\tGT_90_Points\tThis elegant Cabernet Franc is drinking beautifully, just beginning to round out the hardness of youth.

Yet incredibly ripe cherry, raspberry, strawberry and cola flavors give it weight and importance, making it sweetly delicious. Brilliant acidity provides balance, suggesting pairing it with barbecued steak. But there's also as guarantee foraging as you can get in a California Pinot Noir.

The nose is centered around a core of molasses and brown sugar, while the palate bubbles with maple and toffee. Yes, it's a sweeter-styled Amontillado, but the sugar fades on the palate, leaving only the complex residue of caramel, espresso and burnt cinnamon. A lovely wine for any fan of serious Sherry.\n21627\tSpain\tDon PX\t93\t29\tAndalucia\tMontilla-Moriles\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Toro Albala, SL 2004 Don PX Pedro Xim??nez (Montilla-Moriles)\tPedro Xim??nez\tBodegas Toro Albala, SL\tGT_90_Points\tUltra concentrated and sticky, with unctuous but wholesome raisin aromas taken to a level that's almost heavenly.

This is an ultraripe Levante bruiser, with a jammy yet defined structure and huge flavors of baked blackberry, exotic spice, dusty mineral and toasty oak.

Here we're talking about color, bouquet, palate feel, intense flavors, finish, you name it. It's pure, ultratasty, chocolaty, smooth and pleasurable. Astrales is the complete package and a wine to watch.\n115795\tSpain\tReserva\t93\t53\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago de los Capellanes 2004 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo Blend\tPago de los Capellanes\tGT_90_Points\tCapellanes waded through some weak efforts in 2002 and 2003, but this vintage marks undisputed excellence for a reserva. The wine has alluring smoky, sultry notes to match its bold fruit, while the flavors of blackberry, dark spice and chocolate announce perfect raw material and a deft winemaking hand, i.e. controlled oak. Delicious now through 2014.\n115799\tSpain\tMartinet Bru\t92\t40\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMas Martinet 2005 Martinet Bru Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tMas Martinet\tGT_90_Points\tOne can make the argument that in 2005, Martinet Bru, Mas Martinet's �??second�?? wine, is every bit as good and quite a bit more approachable than Clos Martinet. This wine is entirely solid and free of holes. It shows deep, ripe cassis and berry flavors along with chocolaty richness and accents of sage and herbs. Drink now through 2012. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.\n24580\tSpain\tReserva\t91\t55\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVal Sotillo 2011 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tVal Sotillo\tGT_90_Points\tSavory black-olive aromas lend some funk to the nose of this tight pointy massively tannic Tempranillo.

This vintage is excellent, the best since 2001. It offers sweet, ripe black fruit with solid but balanced tannins. Chocolate and leather give the finish sweetness and style, while the overall take is that this is a forceful but sexy wine. Best in a couple of years through 2014. A Europvin, Christopher Cannan selection, imported by multiple importers, including Michael Skurnik Wines.\n40244\tSpain\t\t91\t46\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFerrer Bobet 2013 Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tFerrer Bobet\tGT_90_Points\tA bright purple tint announces a jumpy youthful-smelling wine with plum, black currant and oak aromas. This is Carignan, Syrah, Garnacha and Cab Sauvignon, and it's full in body but also juicy and lively. Savory, saucy plum and berry flavors ride a wave of crisp acidity, while the finish feels dry and exact, with minty medicinal overtones. Drink this snappy wine through 2021.\n13049\tSpain\t\t90\t40\tNorthern Spain\tSomontano\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEnate 2012 Merlot (Somontano)\tMerlot\tEnate\tGT_90_Points\tRipe, stout and smoky dark-berry aromas are spicy and a bit hot. This lush Merlot from a warm year is voluminous and chubby, with heft and full extraction. Spicy, toasty blackberry and cassis flavors come with chocolaty oak, while this is dense, chewy and mouth coating on the finish.

Orange, mango and a touch of brown sugar fill out the flavor profile, while a smooth finish avoids stickiness by offering up bracing acidity.\n50703\tSpain\tVi?�as Viejas\t93\t69\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tGarc??a Figuero 2012 Vi?�as Viejas  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tGarc??a Figuero\tGT_90_Points\tConcentrated tight-grained oaky aromas rest on top of deep smoky blackberry and cassis scents. This is solid as an ox and quite ripe across the palate. Flavors of blackberry, pepper, fine oak and herbs are integrated, while a toasty chocolaty lightly herbal finish tastes and feels right. Drink through 2022.\n116269\tSpain\tOld Vines No. 3\t90\t73\tAndalucia\tM?�laga\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tJorge Ord???�ez & Co. 2007 Old Vines No. 3 Moscatel (M?�laga)\tMoscatel\tJorge Ord???�ez & Co.\tGT_90_Points\tPeach and apricot aromas are a touch grassy, as if some alfalfa or sweet grass were blended into the Moscatel. The palate is juicy and quite high in acidity, while it tastes of tangerine and other citrus fruits. Sharp on one hand but fresh and flavorful on the other.\n22137\tSpain\tDehesa Gago\t91\t18\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodr??guez 2014 Dehesa Gago  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tTelmo Rodr??guez\tGT_90_Points\tSmooth, lush blackberry, blueberry and pastry aromas cue up a fully tannic but well-balanced palate. This wine tastes toasty, chocolaty and peppery, with underlying ripe blackberry fruit. A minty, toasty finish runs chocolaty and long, with no let up.

It is tight, tannic and mildly astringent on the palate, with high-tension structure. Wild berry flavors are gamey in nature, with spice, tobacco and earth notes adding complexity. Drink this old vine wine now through 2022.\n876\tSpain\tIdus\t90\t50\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVall Llach 2007 Idus Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tVall Llach\tGT_90_Points\tRipe and sweet, with lush, raisiny aromas. The palate is flush, deep and layered, with baked berry, prune, toast and coffee flavors. This is a lot like Vall Llach's signature '07, but it's a bit more restrained and at $50 it's a better deal than the $95 wine. Still, it's a heavyweight to drink now through 2013.\n881\tSpain\tCoraje\t90\t44\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFuentes 2008 Coraje Red (Priorat)\tRed Blend\tFuentes\tGT_90_Points\tRipe black fruit aromas aren't overly complex or nuanced but they are generous. Feels tight, gritty and healthy, with firm tannins in front of black cherry and blackberry flavors. Mellows on the finish, where plum and prune flavors take over. Not a hard, fierce Priorat; drink now through 2014.\n13907\tSpain\tPrivat Reserva Brut Nature Ros??\t91\t22\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlta Alella 2014 Privat Reserva Brut Nature Ros??

Aromas of white flowers distant mineral and green melon set up a plump, layered palate, with core acidity but also flatness that will only increase the longer it goes. Flavors of nectarine, orange and melon register as citric but also creamy. This is a unique Galician white that's stylish but won't last forever; drink immediately.\n12895\tSpain\tMonte Real Reserva\t91\t27\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Riojanas 2004 Monte Real Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Riojanas\tGT_90_Points\tRipe and leaning to the dark fruit side, with spicy blackberry aromas. Feels round and complete as it unfolds, and not at all edgy. Flavors of plum, cocoa and spice come with toasty oak, and the finish is bright and snappy. Will age for another decade without much trouble, but it's more than drinkable now.\n89299\tSpain\t\t90\t40\tNorthern Spain\tValdeorras\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEscalada Do Sil 2014 Red (Valdeorras)\tRed Blend\tEscalada Do Sil\tGT_90_Points\tFor a different breed of cat, take a look at this blend of Merenzao (Trousseau), Menc??a and Garnacha from Valdeorras in Galicia. An elegant, schisty nose displays gamy, savory plum and currant aromas similar to Pinot Noir. A choppy, astringent palate makes this wine less than smooth. Herbal plum and spicy oak flavors are bolstered by racy acidity and finish long and almost citrusy in flavor. Drink through 2022.\n124441\tSpain\tTorre Muga\t94\t96\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMuga 2005 Torre Muga  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMuga\tGT_90_Points\tA rich, bacony, black fruit monster with deep, molten flavors and immense body and tannic grab. A bruising wine with boysenberry, blackberry, mint, licorice and chocolate for primary flavors, and then lemony oak as a backdrop. Young, tannic and wild now; best from 2011 through 2015.\n18500\tSpain\tReserva\t90\t48\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMatarromera 2005 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tMatarromera\tGT_90_Points\tCedar, cigar box and earth notes blend with ripe berry aromas to give a subtle, charming bouquet.

And Tres Olmos is that rare wine that smells great, tastes just right, and lingers for a long time on your teased and tested palate. Almond, pear and citrus aromas smartly give way to a smooth wave of blended citrus fruits. The finish is long and confident. Drink now.\n41191\tSpain\tDigma Reserva\t91\t75\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo de Sajazarra 2009 Digma Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tCastillo de Sajazarra\tGT_90_Points\tClassic Rioja aromas of rooty black fruits, vanilla, dill and herbs are the greeting on this full-force, saturated wine. Blackberry, cola, vanilla and coffee flavors are spicy and finish with notes of buttery oak and root beer as well as core strength. Best from 2018 through 2022.\n16599\tSpain\tAtteca Old Vines\t91\t16\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Ateca 2010 Atteca Old Vines Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tBodegas Ateca\tGT_90_Points\tEmphatically toasty and charred on the nose, this offers chocolate and hickory aromas. It feels smooth, plush, layered and not at all simple, with baked black-fruit flavors that are draped over savory barbecue and spice accents. The toast is present but not overpowering on the finish.\n39634\tSpain\tLatitud 40+\t91\t60\tSpain Other\tSpain\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCarmen Lopez Delgado 2013 Latitud 40+ Graciano (Spain)\tGraciano\tCarmen Lopez Delgado\tGT_90_Points\tA huge Graciano is what this is. Hailing from Toledo, this 16% abv heavyweight is seriously fruity and massive on the nose, with a mash-up of blackberry, boysenberry and peppery aromas. Layered blackberry, cassis and blackened toast flavors finish much the same, with juicy, edgy acidity. Drink through 2021.\n76013\tSpain\tSan Rom?�n\t95\t50\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMaurodos 2004 San Rom?�n  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tMaurodos\tGT_90_Points\tAbout as good as it gets in terms of a powerful, fully oaked modern wine that still guards its core identity while offering plenty of straightforward drinking pleasure. San Roman in 2004 is a high-speed train with agile fruit and bracing acidity more dominating than, say, tannic might or alcoholic heat. Among the brave new world of modern wines from Toro this is one of the very best. 6,500 cases produced.\n76282\tSpain\tManzanilla Pasada Pastrana Single Vineyard\t92\t30\tAndalucia\tManzanilla-Sanl?�car de Barrameda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Hidalgo NV Manzanilla Pasada Pastrana Single Vineyard Sherry (Manzanilla-Sanl?�car de Barrameda)\tSherry\tBodegas Hidalgo\tGT_90_Points\tOily aromas of almond extract and peanut butter are earthy, a tad briny and classic in terms of offering buttery, yeasty notes of flor. This feels round, oily and deeply textured. Flavors of almond skins, sea salt and dried stone fruits finish loud and long.\n18433\tSpain\tSingle Vineyard Estate Bottled\t91\t40\tCentral Spain\tDominio de Valdepusa\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Gri?�on 2005 Single Vineyard Estate Bottled Syrah (Dominio de Valdepusa)\tSyrah\tMarques de Gri?�on\tGT_90_Points\tBeautiful aromas of forest floor, dusty berry and smoked meats lead to a huge, tannic but tolerable mouthful of toasty blackberry, cassis, chocolate and additional darkness. It's toasty and really long on the finish; almost syrupy but not quite. A tannic effort, like all Gri?�on wines.\n1111\tSpain\tReserva Brut Nature\t90\t25\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastellroig 2010 Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tCastellroig\tGT_90_Points\tThe nose falls somewhere between smoky and gritty, while dusty white-fruit scents prop things up. Peachy acidity and citric tang let you know this is a �??nature�??

In the mouth, this is solid but not thick. Dry peach and nectarine flavors are clean and finish with just enough girth to chew on.\n123081\tSpain\tClio\t93\t46\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Nido 2006 Clio Red (Jumilla)\tRed Blend\tEl Nido\tGT_90_Points\tOddly, this is preferable to El Nido's $140 Cab-heavy fruit bomb.

After that, it becomes an insider's wine. Why do we say that? Because it's not like a Napa, Washington or Chilean Cabernet that oozes cassis, plum and sweet French oak. Instead, it shows the terroir of the Mas La Plana vineyard in northeast Spain, and with airing (decanting even better) it becomes a sexy, interesting, Old World Cabernet that delivers provoking, earthier flavors.

Drink immediately.\n81444\tSpain\t\t85\t12\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOtazu 2012 Chardonnay (Navarra)\tChardonnay\tOtazu\tLT_90_Points\tApple aromas come with a mild but noticeable burn. This feels dense and thick, with creaminess to the palate. Flavors of pear, melon and banana slow down and thicken up on the finish, which is round and not at all complex.\n81447\tSpain\t\t85\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPalacio de Bornos 2012 Sauvignon Blanc (Rueda)\tSauvignon Blanc\tPalacio de Bornos\tLT_90_Points\tAngular, slightly sweaty aromas let you know up front that this is Sauvignon Blanc. In the mouth, it's a bit soft and short on acidity. Flavors of mango, banana and brown sugar finish with candied sweetness and a shot of bitterness.\n99853\tSpain\tGran Reserva\t89\t48\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasado Morales 2006 Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tCasado Morales\tLT_90_Points\tRipe aromas of roasted coffee and black fruit filter onto a plump, layered and approachable palate.

Mint, a strong clove characteristic and dark fruit flavors control the finish.\n79628\tSpain\tFurvus\t89\t34\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVinyes Dom??nech 2006 Furvus Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tVinyes Dom??nech\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of mineral and jammy raspberry are attractive, yet the palate seems a bit metallic and clicky, with hard to penetrate flavors of rooty fruits, vanilla, coconut and cola. Opens with airing to display secondary berry fruit flavors in front of a tough, firm finish. Nice and ripe, and ready to drink.\n79633\tSpain\tCrianza\t89\t29\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMatarromera 2007 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tMatarromera\tLT_90_Points\tRooty smelling, with cola, sarsparilla, spiced meats and leafy berry aromas. The palate is plump and soft but healthy, with round, sweet berry fruit flavors and ample spice. A generous wine that's hefty, broad and ready to drink. Impressive given that its run is 45,000 cases.\n10043\tSpain\tOpus Evolutium Privat Gran Reserva Brut Nature\t89\t46\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlta Alella 2009 Opus Evolutium Privat Gran Reserva Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tAlta Alella\tLT_90_Points\tWhite fruits, fennel and Serrano ham aromas create a sophisticated bouquet. This jabs away on the palate courtesy of citric acidity, while flavors of nectarine and citrus are good. It finishes dry and foamy.\n46921\tSpain\tFermentado en Barrica\t89\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValserrano 2015 Fermentado en Barrica White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tValserrano\tLT_90_Points\tToasty melon and peach aromas are oaky but elegant, sort of like nice Burgundy. A round balanced palate definitely suggests quality Chardonnay, but this is 95% Viura and the rest Malvasia. Oak and spice flavors render white-fruit notes secondary, and the finish is more of the same. Drink through 2020.\n46922\tSpain\tSein\t89\t45\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVinessens 2013 Sein Monastrell-Syrah (Alicante)\tMonastrell-Syrah\tVinessens\tLT_90_Points\tPlum and blueberry aromas display a hint of desert herbs. A full dense palate is jammy in feel, while blackberry and prune flavors come with herbal savory notes. A mix of toasty oak and prune-like flavors on the finish leave a lasting impression of maximum ripeness. Drink through 2021.\n10047\tSpain\tF\t89\t85\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Fuentespina 2009 F  (Ribera del Duero)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Fuentespina\tLT_90_Points\tRubbery, rooty aromas of herbs and berries blend with stalky red-fruit notes. This feels shrill and tangy, with hard tannins, while flavors of roasted berry fruits come with a leafy undercurrent. Roasted, herbal, oaky flavors settle in on a juicy, high-acid finish. Drink through 2020.\n28299\tSpain\tVivanco Tempranillo-Garnacha\t86\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tDinast??a Vivanco 2012 Vivanco Tempranillo-Garnacha Ros??

The mouthfeel is fresh and acidic, while the flavors of candied berry fruits come across dilute and with little depth.\n9576\tSpain\tArtazuri\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Artazu 2012 Artazuri Garnacha (Navarra)\tGarnacha\tBodegas Artazu\tLT_90_Points\tRaw raspberry and plum aromas feed into a crisp, edgy palate with grating acidity.

Lime and apple flavors are slightly briny, while this is dry, pithy and true to the Garnacha Blanca variety on the finish.\n60912\tSpain\tPazo Barrantes\t89\t19\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPazo de Barrantes 2010 Pazo Barrantes Albari?�o (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?�o\tPazo de Barrantes\tLT_90_Points\tPretty to sniff, with aromas of lemon, fresh white fruits and minerals. Feels crisp, chiseled and racy, with blazing acidity propelling green apple, lime, green melon and saline flavors. Long on the finish. Drink now.\n9578\tSpain\tTarima\t86\t9\tLevante\tAlicante\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVolver 2012 Tarima Monastrell (Alicante)\tMonastrell\tVolver\tLT_90_Points\tBlackberry and boysenberry aromas are a touch grassy and green in the middle. This is chunky, jammy and fairly concentrated in the mouth, with blackberry and cocoa notes. A loamy, plump finish is friendly and offers plenty of weight and density.\n9585\tSpain\t\t85\t8\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?�a Vilano 2013 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tVi?�a Vilano\tLT_90_Points\tPeach and lemon curd aromas are good but basic. A plump, melony palate displays freshness and flavors of honeydew, papaya and lime. A soft but not flabby palate is just bright enough.\n16222\tSpain\tInspiraci??n Valdemar Selecci??n\t87\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Valdemar 2010 Inspiraci??n Valdemar Selecci??n  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Valdemar\tLT_90_Points\tPlum and berry aromas are leathery but honest and not overreaching. The wine feels tight and pinched, while savory flavors of saucy plum and red-berry fruits finish lightly herbal, with a kick of tomato and spice along with leather.\n28285\tSpain\tCrianza\t86\t9\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPr??ncipe de Viana 2009 Crianza Red (Navarra)\tRed Blend\tPr??ncipe de Viana\tLT_90_Points\tRubbery, woodsy aromas of wild berries and balsamic vinegar are spicy and suggestive of Bordeaux. Leafy flavors of plum, pie cherry and spice are herbal but not green, while this value blend's peppery, dry finish is juicy and composed.\n28295\tSpain\tCordon Negro Brut\t86\t12\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFreixenet NV Cordon Negro Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tFreixenet\tLT_90_Points\tDusty apple-driven aromas are simple but true to what brut Cava is about.

It feels tangy, with a light herb flavor working in tandem with dry plum and berry notes. Briary, spicy and drying on the finish.\n60656\tSpain\t\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tYllera 2013 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tTempranillo\tYllera\tLT_90_Points\tPlum and cherry aromas are earthy and generic. This wine feels pinched and high in acidity. Flavors of tart plum and berry fruits are racy, while a long, salty, tannic finish is pushed by crisp acidity.\n118610\tSpain\tLibrato\t86\t12\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Aresan 2005 Librato Red (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Aresan\tLT_90_Points\tThis five-grape blend straddles the gamut of aromas and flavors. It starts with a flat, aged cheese and tobacco nose before opening to show cassis, raspberry and other solid fruit flavors. The finish is sturdy and lengthy, and overall it delivers a round feel and good expression.\n3718\tSpain\tEl Albar Lurton Barricas\t88\t24\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFran??ois Lurton 2009 El Albar Lurton Barricas Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tTempranillo\tFran??ois Lurton\tLT_90_Points\tBig and forward on the bouquet, this has loud, fiery black-cherry and berry aromas. Like most Lurton wines of Spanish origin, El Albar is chewy and ripe, with a syrupy feel and flavors of blackberry, stewed plum and spice cake. The finish is chocolaty, beefy and concentrated.\n3720\tSpain\t\t88\t12\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPazo Serantellos 2011 Albari?�o (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?�o\tPazo Serantellos\tLT_90_Points\tMinerally as well as lemony and zesty on the nose, this is nevertheless neither pushy nor intense. The palate offers good acidity and razor-sharp clarity, along with flavors of pineapple and apple. Alert on the finish, this is a firm refresher.\n3728\tSpain\tGran Brut\t86\t14\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo Rocio NV Gran Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tCastillo Rocio\tLT_90_Points\tThis smells wild and yeasty, like sourdough bread blended with a hot summer field. Flavors of white fruits and melon are briny, while this closes with dry white-fruit flavors and peppery notes.\n91094\tSpain\tGran Colegiata Campus\t86\t38\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Fari?�a 2004 Gran Colegiata Campus  (Toro)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Fari?�a\tLT_90_Points\tRaisiny and sweeet smelling, with baked qualities but also a bitter bite of horseradish. The palate is deep and hard, with burnt notes, tough tannins and berry flavors softened by buttery oak. Beefy and rubbery, but with enough ripeness to be worth a look.\n112214\tSpain\t9\t85\t15\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEquilibrio 2013 9 Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tEquilibrio\tLT_90_Points\tRustic, leathery aromas of brandied cherry, red currant and resiny oak set up a full, round palate. This Monastrell tastes earthy and a bit flat, with mild spice notes accenting core prune flavors. A beefy, loamy, thick finish brings herbal notes.\n120644\tSpain\tFaustino VII\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Faustino 2006 Faustino VII  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Faustino\tLT_90_Points\tQuite standard but that doesn't mean it isn't a good wine and doesn't fit a purpose. For regular, everyday Rioja this should not fail. It has nice cherry and plum aromas with a hint of rubber and tobacco. Licorice, plum, raspberry and brown sugar flavors work the balanced, controlled palate, while the finish is natural and unforced. 235,000 cases made.\n65381\tSpain\tSorbo a Sorbo Old Vines\t84\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLo Nuevo 2010 Sorbo a Sorbo Old Vines Garnacha (Calatayud)\tGarnacha\tLo Nuevo\tLT_90_Points\tBurnt, stalky, toasted aromas dominate this inexpensive Garnacha, and there's not much freshness to the nose as a result. In the mouth, it's more of the same; things are heavy, with fully oaked flavors of medicinal berry, hickory and barbecued meat.\n64586\tSpain\t\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tSomontano\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?�as del Vero 2009 Chardonnay (Somontano)\tChardonnay\tVi?�as del Vero\tLT_90_Points\tWaxy on the nose, with buttercup, creamy yellow-fruit scents and white flowers. The palate is wet, racy and a touch like soda, with sweet, candied flavors of peach and melon. Plods along with good enough acidity to support the wine's core sweetness and candied qualities.\n23750\tSpain\tRam??n Roqueta\t88\t12\tCatalonia\tCatalunya\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas 1898 2011 Ram??n Roqueta Tempranillo (Catalunya)\tTempranillo\tBodegas 1898\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a very nice value wine with balsam wood, almond candy, cola and black-fruit aromas. The palate feels pure and fresh, with a ton of plum, berry, cocoa and tobacco flavors. It's smooth, long and solid on the finish.\n114626\tSpain\tVendimia Seleccionada Selecci??n\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Muriel 2009 Vendimia Seleccionada Selecci??n  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Muriel\tLT_90_Points\tSweet blueberry, dry wood, sawdust, vanilla and toast aromas lead to a chunky palate with jammy berry flavors accented by fairly forceful oak. Finishes similarly, with ample barrel influence, vanilla and medium length.\n24262\tSpain\tLZ\t87\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodr??guez 2010 LZ  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tTelmo Rodr??guez\tLT_90_Points\tBlack-fruit aromas are forceful, toasty and gritty. It feels solid, fruity and full bodied, with black fruit flavors that come across ripe and generous. It's oaky but not overly so.\n24264\tSpain\tCordon Negro Brut 150 a?�os\t87\t12\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFreixenet NV Cordon Negro Brut 150 a?�os Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tFreixenet\tLT_90_Points\tFreixenet's signature Cava is consistent and pure as usual, with aromas of white fruit and white pepper and an overall freshness on the nose. It feels crisp and focused, with a foamy palate that brings apple, lime, peach and spice flavors. The finish is smooth.\n110131\tSpain\tReserva\t89\t39\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValenciso 2002 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tValenciso\tLT_90_Points\tRustic, smoky and deep on the nose, with a creamy body holding up commendable raspberry and plum flavors. Valenciso deals medium-level acids and tannins, with oak-based mocha and chocolate carrying the finish. This wine is so close to reaching the next level, but it doesn't quite get there.\n54845\tSpain\tVi?�a Alarde Crianza\t85\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBerberana 2005 Vi?�a Alarde Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBerberana\tLT_90_Points\tSimple but steady and composed. This is throwback-style Rioja crianza, meaning it's moderately oaked and not very fat or expressive. Strawberry and cherry flavors run the show, and the mouthfeel is fresh. More innocuous than detailed, which means it'll do fine by-the-glass.\n23762\tSpain\t\t88\t24\tNorthern Spain\tBierzo\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAbad Dom Bueno 2011 Godello (Bierzo)\tGodello\tAbad Dom Bueno\tLT_90_Points\tDusty apple and white peach aromas provide a nice greeting. The wine is basic and tangy in terms of feel, with lemon-lime, bitter lettuce, banana, nectarine and pineapple flavors. While not exactly complex or elevated, it delivers pure citrus characteristics offset by solid minerality.\n64636\tSpain\tSombrero Rojo Crianza\t84\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Barriosa 2005 Sombrero Rojo Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Barriosa\tLT_90_Points\tCherry and dried cranberry aromas along with the magenta color give this wine a �??red�?? personality, which is confirmed by the crisp red-fruit flavor profile. Fairly light in weight, but juicy and fresh, with cleansing acidity and some sharpness.\n87569\tSpain\tReserva Cuv??e Barcelona 1872\t85\t\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCodorn??u NV Reserva Cuv??e Barcelona 1872 Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tCodorn??u\tLT_90_Points\tClover and apple aromas are basic but fresh. This is simple on the palate, with little to the mouthfeel. Vapid flavors of soda crackers, spent yeast and apple cider disappear on a quick finish.\n120731\tSpain\t\t86\t19\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPazo San Mauro 2015 Albari?�o (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?�o\tPazo San Mauro\tLT_90_Points\tYeasty melon and white-fruit aromas are a bit strained and gritty.

This is round and punchy on the palate, with raspberry, plum, herb and spice flavors. On the finish, it is fresh and not too demanding, with steady, firm tannins.\n108123\tSpain\tExtra Dry\t86\t10\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSegura Viudas NV Extra Dry Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tSegura Viudas\tLT_90_Points\tDry apple and crisp citrus aromas come with a touch of sweet grass. It has lively lemon-lime and apple flavors, and it seems to have beeen dosed on the sweeter side of extra dry. Overall, it's fruity, friendly and likable.\n108128\tSpain\tEternum Viti\t86\t22\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Abanico 2009 Eternum Viti  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tBodegas Abanico\tLT_90_Points\tThis starts with funky, saucy aromas that clean up and become less strange with airing. Rugged, tannic and bumpy on the palate, it has baked, rubbery black-fruit flavors. It finishes short and drying, with hard tannins and heat.\n108137\tSpain\tMercat Brut Nature\t86\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEl Xamfr?� NV Mercat Brut Nature Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tEl Xamfr?�\tLT_90_Points\tApple and dry spice aromas comprise the restrained but pleasant bouquet.

In the mouth, clove and heavy oak notes are dominant, while the feel is rubbery and rough.

In the mouth, this veers off course. It's highly acidic, with a shearing character that turns plum and berry fruit sour. Tongue-smacking and astringent on the finish. Tasted twice with mostly similar findings.\n56943\tSpain\tVi?�a Temprana\t82\t8\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Aragonesas 2013 Vi?�a Temprana Garnacha (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha\tBodegas Aragonesas\tLT_90_Points\tSoupy, volatile plum and berry aromas are stalky.

The nose is pure cherry and raspberry, but in subdued doses. Meanwhile, it's zesty, foamy and fresh in the mouth, with nectarine, plum, strawberry and prickle. Perfectly nice for everyday quaffing.\n72840\tSpain\tReserva\t86\t52\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCathar 2006 Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tCathar\tLT_90_Points\tGritty, heavily roasted aromas of stewed berry, coffee grinds and compost are less than appealing, although with airing things improve. This is wide and blocky in the mouth, with ripe, raisiny, roasted black-fruit flavors matched by bitter espresso. Molasses and heat drive the finish on this pricey wine that's not in great shape.\n60716\tSpain\tOld Vines\t84\t19\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa L'Angel 2010 Old Vines Cabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo (Valencia)\tCabernet Sauvignon-Tempranillo\tCasa L'Angel\tLT_90_Points\tInitially, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Tempranillo smells vegetal, although the nose settles on saucy tomato and bell pepper. Fairly raw and astringent on the palate, this tastes like pizza in a glass, meaning basil, oregano and tomato flavors are dominant. The finish is mildly green but feels right.\n65135\tSpain\t\t87\t40\tNorthern Spain\tEmpord?�\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOliver Conti 2009 White (Empord?�)\tWhite Blend\tOliver Conti\tLT_90_Points\tThis mature blend of Gewurztraminer, Sauvignon Blanc and Macabeo is oily, plump and fragrant, but also blocky, chunky and on its last legs of freshness.

The palate follows suit; it's reasonably balanced, with forward strawberry, raspberry and mocha flavors. Dry and quick on the finish, with a mild resiny leftover oak character.\n28562\tSpain\tFill del Temps Gran Selecci??\t81\t25\tCatalonia\tTerra Alta\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCovilalba 2004 Fill del Temps Gran Selecci?? Red (Terra Alta)\tRed Blend\tCovilalba\tLT_90_Points\tRooty on the nose, with green herb, tea and raspberry aromas. Patience and airing only brings it to the acceptable level, which means the wine's reasonably good prune and dark-fruit flavors are scuttled by a disjointed, overly acidic mouthfeel.\n111722\tSpain\tOld Vines\t88\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNisia 2012 Old Vines Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tNisia\tLT_90_Points\tThis Verdejo is fruity and tropical on the bouquet.

This blend of 90% Viura and 10% Malvasia feels healthy, round and whole, with balancing acidity. Peach, melon and baked apple flavors finish long and secure. For a four-year-old white Rioja, this is in fine shape.

The nose has more than a twinge of tomato leaf, wet clay, tobacco and raisin, but also maturity and floral notes akin to a good Burgundy. Meanwhile, the palate pitches tomato leaf, cranberry, tobacco and dried plum flavors. A little bit light and reedy by modern standards, but alluring as well. Drink now.

A round, pulpy palate is balanced by citric acidity, while waxy flavors of baked apple and peach finish briny and round, with a hint of green banana.\n9370\tSpain\tTinto Reserva\t83\t49\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPago de los Capellanes 2002 Tinto Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tPago de los Capellanes\tLT_90_Points\tEveryone who follows Spain and the Mediterranean basin knows that 2002 was a cool, miserly year. But still, this wine is offering almost nothing. It's tart, limited and borderline sour. There isn't much middle or body to it, so expect scratchy red fruit and lots of wayward acidity.\n9372\tSpain\tSolaz Blanco\t83\t10\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOsborne 2006 Solaz Blanco Viura (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tViura\tOsborne\tLT_90_Points\tVibrant to the point of spritzy, with more tartness than cushion. This is a sharp rendition of Viura that emphasizes grapefruit and lemon. It stretches astringency to its limit, and yet some may like it because it will never be confused for plodding.\n99913\tSpain\tJaloco Roble\t82\t12\tCentral Spain\tRibera del Guadiana\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Medina 2011 Jaloco Roble Red (Ribera del Guadiana)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Medina\tLT_90_Points\tJammy and candied smelling, this has a green element akin to alfalfa or mint. It's clampy, tannic and high in acid, with raspberry and plum notes that offer an oak offset. The flavors turn tangy and sharp on the finish, even as a heavy vanilla flavor settles in.\n3231\tSpain\t\t88\t17\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVal do Sosego 2011 Albari?�o (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?�o\tVal do Sosego\tLT_90_Points\tRipe apple aromas make the nose nice, even though it's flattening with age. Likewise on the palate, which delivers pithy orange and dry melon flavors along with indications that it's just starting to fade. Notes of green herbs and scallion come up on the finish. Drink this mature white immediately.\n3237\tSpain\tTreyu\t88\t16\tNorthern Spain\tEmpord?�\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tOliver Conti 2011 Treyu White (Empord?�)\tWhite Blend\tOliver Conti\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose on this blend of Gewurztraminer and Macabeo defines neutral; it's clean but shows little more than a whiff of apple. The palate is fresh and quick moving, with mild peach, pear, apple and melon flavors that culminate in a solid finish that's not very exciting but doesn't stray.\n46237\tSpain\tVi?�a Alarba Old Vines\t86\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCalatayud\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas y Vinedos del Jal??n 2008 Vi?�a Alarba Old Vines Grenache (Calatayud)\tGrenache\tBodegas y Vinedos del Jal??n\tLT_90_Points\tThe opening of smoke, rubber and black cherry comes across as being dark and good. The palate holds form with lively cherry, plum and currant flavors and finally a medium-long, somewhat warm and meaty finish. Good for an everyday, no-frills Garnacha.\n75414\tSpain\t\t86\t8\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tWrongo Dongo 2008 Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tWrongo Dongo\tLT_90_Points\tPerfectly drinkable Monastrell year after year despite the silly name. Plum and roasted berry aromas and flavors are sweet, ripe, clean and on the generic side of the fence. A little rugged and hot at 15%, but lusty and good for the price.\n73411\tSpain\tAndi??n\t86\t18\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas N?�?�ez 2013 Andi??n Albari?�o (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?�o\tBodegas N?�?�ez\tLT_90_Points\tA mild bouquet of generic stone-fruit aromas is a touch empty but friendly. This is mild on the palate, with modest acidity and not much minerally kick. Briny, leesy nectarine flavors finish round in feel. Drink immediately.\n79181\tSpain\tEl Cerezo Unoaked\t88\t11\tNorthern Spain\tNavarra\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCastillo de Monjardin 2015 El Cerezo Unoaked Chardonnay (Navarra)\tChardonnay\tCastillo de Monjardin\tLT_90_Points\tFresh and minerally, melon and peach aromas introduce the medium-bodied palate. Flavors of peach, melon and passion fruit finish clean and modest.\n91416\tSpain\t\t86\t12\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCondesa Eylo 2011 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tCondesa Eylo\tLT_90_Points\tIodine and celery aromas dominate the nose, which offers mild fruit-driven scents of apple and lime. This feels firm but nothing north of normal, with generic white-fruit flavors of lychee and apple mixed with green herbs. A cleansing finish can best be described as fresh.\n79445\tSpain\tJC\t89\t24\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVizcarra 2007 JC  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tVizcarra\tLT_90_Points\tInitiates with savory, mildly soupy aromas on top of berry fruit. The palate is plump, ripe and balanced, with mocha, coffee and dark, meaty berry flavors. Toasty, dry and very solid on the finish, and convincingly rich as a whole.\n90906\tSpain\tHalcon\t80\t13\tNorthern Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVega de Tera 2014 Halcon Verdejo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla y Le??n)\tVerdejo\tVega de Tera\tLT_90_Points\tThis is a heartbeat or two from being DOA. Tan in color with an oily heavy mouthfeel, this tastes oxidized and shows almost no pulse.\n29923\tSpain\tComa Alta\t86\t36\tCatalonia\tPriorat\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMas d'en Gil 2012 Coma Alta Grenache Blanc (Priorat)\tGrenache Blanc\tMas d'en Gil\tLT_90_Points\tA strong whiff of gasoline and/or diesel is pure petrol. Tight and oily in feel, this mature white tastes pithy, yeasty, waxy and low on fruit character. A dry finish with flavors of papaya and white pepper is short on freshness.\n91418\tSpain\t\t86\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEgeo 2012 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tEgeo\tLT_90_Points\tMelon, mango and papaya aromas are tropical and lead to a smooth, creamy palate with sweet orange, melon and baking spice flavors. Nothing is complicated or edgy; this is standard Verdejo that's easy to drink.\n78940\tSpain\t\t85\t9\tLevante\tJumilla\t\t\t\tBodegas Agapito Rico 2000 Monastrell (Jumilla)\tMonastrell\tBodegas Agapito Rico\tLT_90_Points\tDryly fruited, this light and flavorful Monastrell (aka Mourv?�edre) blend is a winning, easy drinker. Clean and direct, with dry cherry licorice and mineral shadings, it's a simple and satisfying mouthful, great for patio dining with lighter grilled foods. Best Buy. �??M.M.\n78949\tSpain\tMade With Organic Grapes\t88\t18\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tValdelavia NV Made With Organic Grapes Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tValdelavia\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of yeasty pastry, powdered sugar and apple pie come prior to a nervy palate with a mix of tropical melon and papaya flavors along with salad-like garden notes. Flavors of green herbs are prominent on the finish.\n91674\tSpain\t\t82\t20\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVeiga da Princesa 2011 Albari?�o (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?�o\tVeiga da Princesa\tLT_90_Points\tThis is about as strange and individual as Albari?�o gets. The nose oozes odd cinnamon and resin aromas, which are abnormal for the variety and the R??as Baixas region. A flavor of spiced apple finishes with the same spice character. Funky is probably the best word to describe this wine.\n16287\tSpain\tCrianza\t87\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCondado de Oriza 2010 Crianza  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tCondado de Oriza\tLT_90_Points\tWiry aromas of berry and spice are tempered by a touch of oaky vanilla. On the palate, there's a blend of creamy oak and sharp acidity, while flavors of plum and boysenberry are tart overall but again softened by barrel-driven vanilla notes. Snappy acidity makes for a moderately sharp, pointed finish.\n64405\tSpain\tMenguante\t89\t24\tNorthern Spain\tCari?�ena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?�edos y Bodegas Pablo 2007 Menguante Vidadillo (Cari?�ena)\tVidadillo\tVi?�edos y Bodegas Pablo\tLT_90_Points\tThe aromas of wet clay, mild chili peppers, cedar and sweet berry mesh nicely. On the palate it is plump and a touch greasy, with richness in spades along with plum and berry flavors. It feels weighty on the finish, with a licorice note. A very good wine from the little-know Vidadillo grape.\n29929\tSpain\tFuerza\t85\t22\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tEgo Bodegas 2013 Fuerza Red (Jumilla)\tRed Blend\tEgo Bodegas\tLT_90_Points\tA heavy blast of oaky char is the dominant force on the nose. This blend of Monastrell and Cabernet Sauvignon feels cloying. Candied berry and cherry flavors are sugary, baked and oaky, while this finishes with sticky flavors of raisin and sweet milk chocolate.\n64688\tSpain\t\t87\t9\tCentral Spain\tVino de la Tierra de Castilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMaximo 2009 Tempranillo (Vino de la Tierra de Castilla)\tTempranillo\tMaximo\tLT_90_Points\tDusty plum and black cherry aromas feature a touch of dry oak. Tight, snappy and properly tannic in the mouth, with full berry, baked plum and background spice flavors. Finishes with control and power; good red wine for the price.\n28351\tSpain\tSelecci??n\t89\t22\tLevante\tJumilla\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMonterebro 2014 Selecci??n Red (Jumilla)\tRed Blend\tMonterebro\tLT_90_Points\tRipe black-plum and spice aromas are dense and blocky. This is 85% Syrah and 15% Monastrell, with a jammy palate and a touch of heat and flab. Flavors of raisin, blackberry and prune finish earthy, with an echo of prune and moderately scratchy tannins.\n28354\tSpain\t\t89\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tProtos 2015 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tProtos\tLT_90_Points\tWith a yellowish color and round melony aromas that are suggestive of candle wax, this feels oily and a touch viscous, but not fat or out of shape. Dry, slightly salty melon flavors finish strong.\n28361\tSpain\tSelecci??n Especial\t89\t27\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAdegas Gran Vinum 2015 Selecci??n Especial Albari?�o (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?�o\tAdegas Gran Vinum\tLT_90_Points\tCitrus, mineral and honey aromas are good but not all that complex. This feels full and weighty, with nectarine and orange flavors. On the finish, dry citrus flavors are round and lasting but low on elegance. Drink now.\n61000\tSpain\tMade With Organic Grapes\t87\t15\tLevante\tValencia\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa L'Angel 2012 Made With Organic Grapes Syrah-Tempranillo (Valencia)\tSyrah-Tempranillo\tCasa L'Angel\tLT_90_Points\tRed-fruit aromas of currant and raspberry aren't sophisticated but they are good and fruity. Firm and solidly built, this likeable, easy-drinking blend offers plum, blackberry and raspberry flavors along with a loamy finish that contains a ripe hint of raisin.\n61238\tSpain\tHito Rosado\t85\t19\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCepa 21 2013 Hito Rosado Tinto Fino (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tCepa 21\tLT_90_Points\tWith a bright pink color, this shows slightly heavy aromas of watermelon and red apple skins. It is medium to full in body but fresh, with candied red-fruit and citrus flavors. A fresh, properly acidic finish does the job.\n29715\tSpain\tRosa Nautica\t86\t20\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLa Gitana 2014 Rosa Nautica White (Rioja)\tWhite Blend\tLa Gitana\tLT_90_Points\tGrapefruit and other citrus aromas are zesty but standard. That's also how the palate comes across: citric and juicy, but average. Flavors of orange and tangerine finish fresh but continue the one-note theme.\n62821\tSpain\tReserva\t87\t40\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tFinca Valpiedra 2007 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tFinca Valpiedra\tLT_90_Points\tThe nose here is a bit herbal, with a suggestion of eucalyptus along with blackberry and plum. The mouthfeel on this wine is clampy but solid, while the flavors of herbal, roasted berry fruits and moss lead into a mildly herbal and earthy finish. There's a lot of olive-like character to this wine.\n29721\tSpain\t\t86\t16\tNorthern Spain\tRueda\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tParamus 2014 Verdejo (Rueda)\tVerdejo\tParamus\tLT_90_Points\tPeach and a hint of fresh lettuce are the key aromas to a basic bouquet. This feels solid but pithy, while orange and other generic citrus flavors turn slightly bitter on the finish.\n29723\tSpain\tLuno\t86\t17\tCatalonia\tMontsant\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPortal del Priorat 2013 Luno Red (Montsant)\tRed Blend\tPortal del Priorat\tLT_90_Points\tJammy plum and raspberry aromas are meaty and hint at being plush. A flush, fairly full mouthfeel packs power, while flavors of plum and prune fade toward herbal, with residual weight to the finish.\n15329\tSpain\tPrima\t89\t25\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMaurodos 2011 Prima  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tMaurodos\tLT_90_Points\tEarth, leather, a touch of compost, soy, hoison sauce and raisin aromas all vie for attention on this tannic, ripe, almost stewy Toro. Seriously ripe flavors of sun-baked berry fruits and black currant veer towards prune and raisin on a rich, chocolaty, figgy finish.\n63097\tSpain\tTinto 6 Meses en Barrica\t84\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlidis 2013 Tinto 6 Meses en Barrica  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tAlidis\tLT_90_Points\tThe wine has a murky burgundy color and earthy, roasted aromas that include Band-Aid and latex. This feels bold, tangy, tannic and hard. Flavors of plum, tomato and stalky herbs finish with a stewed note and heat.\n60742\tSpain\tCosecha Dorada Seco\t83\t20\tSpain Other\tSpain\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Guti??rrez de la Vega 2014 Cosecha Dorada Seco Moscatel (Spain)\tMoscatel\tBodegas Guti??rrez de la Vega\tLT_90_Points\tGaseous aromas are thick and upfront, with a hint of lychee. This tastes and feels pithy, with a heavy skins component that causes bitterness. Amid that, this dry Muscat tastes soapy, with an oddly floral finish.\n62596\tSpain\t\t86\t10\tNorthern Spain\tCampo de Borja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tPenelope Sanchez 2014 Red (Campo de Borja)\tGarnacha Blend\tPenelope Sanchez\tLT_90_Points\tHeavy oak aromas rest forcefully on top of plum and black cherry scents. This is fresh and proper in feel, with dominant oaky graininess and medicinal berry flavors that finish woody like a plank.\n62599\tSpain\tPeit?�n\t86\t15\tGalicia\tR??as Baixas\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNora 2014 Peit?�n Albari?�o (R??as Baixas)\tAlbari?�o\tNora\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of ocean breeze and white clover are raw but good. This feels round, pulpy and citrusy, with green slightly bitter flavors of citrus, honey and brine. Acidity plays a big role in keeping this afloat. Drink immediately.\n62602\tSpain\tVi?�a Reboreda\t86\t14\tGalicia\tRibeiro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Campante 2014 Vi?�a Reboreda Godello (Ribeiro)\tGodello\tBodegas Campante\tLT_90_Points\tStraightforward peach, nectarine and apple aromas are fleshy, as is the palate, which puts out leesy creamy flavors of apple and green banana. A leesy, low-acid finish is plump and lacks follow through. Drink immediately.\n112282\tSpain\tTinto\t85\t10\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBurgo Viejo 2012 Tinto  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBurgo Viejo\tLT_90_Points\tRaspberry aromas are simple but friendly. This feels condensed and a bit jammy, without a lot of stand-up structure. Candied, lightly loamy flavors of plum and currant finish modest and short.\n3805\tSpain\tReserva Brut\t88\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMont-Ferrant 2008 Reserva Brut Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tMont-Ferrant\tLT_90_Points\tBready, yeasty, oxidized aromas open this up. In the mouth, this is elegant to an extent, with residual acidity keeping things alive. Flavors of white grapefruit finish round and smooth.\n3808\tSpain\tReserva\t88\t44\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBaigorri 2007 Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBaigorri\tLT_90_Points\tUnusual aromas of blue fruits are matched against cardamom and cumin scents. The palate is blocky yet dominated by acidity, while flavors of plum, black currant and woodspice are exotic. A hard finish shows hickory and barrel flavors along with wiry acidity.\n129497\tSpain\tGago\t88\t32\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tTelmo Rodr??guez 2013 Gago  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tTelmo Rodr??guez\tLT_90_Points\tBlackberry and cassis aromas are robust and typical for Toro. In the mouth, however, this is super tannic and like gravel. Dark berry flavors are well oaked, while the finish tastes of blackberry and chocolate but feels tannic as nails. Drink or hold; this will always be a rough wine.\n75183\tSpain\tLimited Edition\t86\t17\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tRam??n Bilbao 2013 Limited Edition  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tRam??n Bilbao\tLT_90_Points\tStalky, lemony, rooty berry aromas set up a grabby palate with lightly earthy plum and berry flavors. Woody, earthy and drying on the finish. Overall, this is a basic Rioja with cool-vintage characteristics.\n75452\tSpain\tVendimia Seleccionada Gran Reserva\t88\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Muriel 2004 Vendimia Seleccionada Gran Reserva  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tBodegas Muriel\tLT_90_Points\tSomewhat neutral on the nose, with light cherry and raspberry aromas. Solid in the mouth, with slightly clacky tannins and flavors of earthy red fruits, light oak and earth. Just ripe and racy enough on the finish, with a calm, reserved personality.\n75455\tSpain\tSecreto Reserva\t88\t30\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVi?�a Mayor 2005 Secreto Reserva  (Ribera del Duero)\tTinto Fino\tVi?�a Mayor\tLT_90_Points\tLicorice, tobacco and berry aromas lead to a crisp and zesty palate that is led by acidity and tastes of red plum, apple skins and raspberry. Tight and mildly astringent on the finish, with snap out the door. Drink now.\n75457\tSpain\tII Crianza\t88\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCovila 2007 II Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo\tCovila\tLT_90_Points\tSweet berry aromas blend with dark chocolate and leather on the nose.

The palate is equally stunted and rough in feel, while tarry, gritty berry flavors finish drawing.\n78952\tSpain\tGR5 Senders\t88\t13\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tVins El Cep 2016 GR5 Senders Xarel-lo (Pened??s)\tXarel-lo\tVins El Cep\tLT_90_Points\tApple and pear aromas are clean as a whistle. This is varietal Xarello, a key grape in Cava production. It is citrusy and minerally in feel, with lemon, tangerine and stony flavors mixed with a touch of yeast. A tight, exact finish is juicy and stony.\n78955\tSpain\tCaprasia\t88\t20\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Vegalfaro 2016 Caprasia Red (Utiel-Requena)\tRed Blend\tBodegas Vegalfaro\tLT_90_Points\tMalty, earthy, roasted berry aromas become more chocolaty as this wine breathes. An oaky, resiny palate is saturated and shows spicy, peppery black-fruit flavors along with some heat. This Bobal-Merlot blend sizzles on a full-throttle finish that's not shy on oak.\n67240\tSpain\tEl Fanio\t87\t20\tCatalonia\tPened??s\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tAlbet I Noya 2015 El Fanio Xarel-lo (Pened??s)\tXarel-lo\tAlbet I Noya\tLT_90_Points\tNeutral, slightly briny aromas are fresh but low on fruit. This has a slightly plump feel but not a lot of length or depth. Short basic white-fruit flavors match the nose, while this Xarello finishes dry in feel and mildly briny in flavor.\n67248\tSpain\tPasi??n de\t87\t15\tLevante\tUtiel-Requena\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tSierra Norte 2014 Pasi??n de Bobal (Utiel-Requena)\tBobal\tSierra Norte\tLT_90_Points\tRoasted smoky plum and berry aromas are slightly oaky. This feels flush, with grabby tannins. Plum and mixed-berry flavors grow more appealing with air, while this tastes roasted and savory on a rugged and tannic finish.\n64955\tSpain\tRoble\t83\t14\tNorthern Spain\tRibera del Duero\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tLeg??n 2008 Roble  (Ribera del Duero)\tTempranillo\tLeg??n\tLT_90_Points\tWarm and smelling of menthol, cough syrup and sweet, jammy berry fruit. The palate is also fairly medicinal in terms of flavor, while the feel is a bit hard and underdeveloped.

This is clean but basic on the palate with citrus, nectarine and lime flavors. A clean refreshing finish is a nice way to wrap things up. This is Sauvignon Blanc and Verdejo.\n54442\tSpain\t\t87\t21\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCasa Primicia 2008  Rioja\tMazuelo\tCasa Primicia\tLT_90_Points\tWiry plum and oaky aromas are powerful.

Peppery spice notes, dry oak and red-fruit ending flavors make for a straight-ahead, modest finish.\n64958\tSpain\tReserva Privada\t85\t80\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarqu??s de Vargas 2007 Reserva Privada  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarqu??s de Vargas\tLT_90_Points\tAromas of raw oak, eucalyptus and gritty berry fruits are hot and leafy. This Tempranillo-based blend feels choppy with aggressive grating tannins. Flavors of baked roasted berry fruits are also herbal, green and leafy, while this finishes crisp, raw and tomatoey in flavor.\n11687\tSpain\tCrianza\t86\t18\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tMarques de Tomares 2011 Crianza  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tMarques de Tomares\tLT_90_Points\tNo two ways about this, it's stalky and earthy on the nose, with mulchy, herbal notes. This feels pinchy and tannic, with roasted red-berry flavors that finish extremely earthy.

It's powerful juice, with a strong mineral/floral element on the bouquet. Aged only a year in oak, it maintains a crisp, charred character and shows tight raspberry flavors, chocolate and pepper. Features all the right stuff for a debut wine from a strained vintage.\n66828\tSpain\tOlsgosa\t87\t13\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Perica 2015 Olsgosa Viura (Rioja)\tViura\tBodegas Perica\tLT_90_Points\tWarm dusty oaky aromas come prior to a citric palate that's high in acidity and thus austere.

It's alert and lively in the mouth, with strawberry, plum, raspberry and citrusy flavors.

Aromas of ripe apple and lychee precede a palate with weight. Residual sugar causes lychee, lime and apple flavors to come across as sweet, while the finish is steady and avoids being cloying.\n29758\tSpain\tAnna Brut Ros??\t83\t15\tCatalonia\tCava\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tCodorn??u NV Anna Brut Ros?? Sparkling (Cava)\tSparkling Blend\tCodorn??u\tLT_90_Points\tOxidized aromas of spent yeast and stale fruit are not fresh. This feels foamy, wayward and unfocused.

Look for generic but fresh peach and citrus aromas and then lip-smacking citrus flavors. Finishes composed and clean, with lasting grapefruit flavor. 60% Verdejo and 40% Viura.\n60569\tSpain\tVolvoreta Probus\t88\t25\tNorthern Spain\tToro\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tNuntia Vini 2005 Volvoreta Probus  (Toro)\tTinta de Toro\tNuntia Vini\tLT_90_Points\tCrushed floral aromas, berry-infused tea and cherry candy aromas give this wine a sweet profile. The palate, however, is anything but. It pounds with toasty black fruit, licorice and fiery menthol. The feel is a bit tannic but not terribly harsh, so maybe another three to five years will serve it well.\n3266\tSpain\tVi?�adrian\t86\t15\tNorthern Spain\tRioja\t\tMichael Schachner\t@wineschach\tBodegas Berceo 2013 Vi?�adrian  (Rioja)\tTempranillo Blend\tBodegas Berceo\tLT_90_Points\tEarthy notes of saline and cheesy leather accent plum aromas on this tight number with rubbery tannins.

The palate has that same taut but very full-fruited feel�??of very tightly held ample fruit reminiscent of red-cheeked, aromatic apples. This is both powerful and svelte.

The palate on this bottling from popular Riesling source Kick-On Ranch is wound up very tight, showing lime skins, focused acidity and a gray-rock minerality.

There is a fine fresh, dry aftertaste.\tBrouillards Premier Cru\tGT_90_Points\t\tBurgundy\tVolnay\t\tRoger Voss\tPinot Noir\tDomaine Jessiaume 2007 Brouillards Premier Cru  (Volnay)\n100634\tUS\tTantara's take on the historic Chalone AVA, which is full of limestone marl and clay near the Pinnacles National Park, kicks off with dusty aromas of red earth, light menthol and raspberry-flavored Smarties candy.

But because it is 2005, the natural exuberance of the fruit is also there, lively red berries under the dry structure. It needs some aging, but already the richness is there, along with a smoky aftertaste.\tPremier Cru\tGT_90_Points\t66\tBurgundy\tPommard\t\tRoger Voss\tPinot Noir\tBouchard P??re & Fils 2005 Premier Cru  (Pommard)\n101162\tFrance\tThis rich, firmly structured wine comes from a nine-acre vineyard close to the village of Pommard. Its ripe black fruits are just starting to show through the dry core. Concentrated and powerful, it will be best from 2022.\tClos de la Commaraine Premier Cru\tGT_90_Points\t79\tBurgundy\tPommard\t\tRoger Voss\tPinot Noir\tLouis Jadot 2014 Clos de la Commaraine Premier Cru  (Pommard)\n79392\tUS\tEarthy cranberry and orange compote surround this soft, seductive wine, made in relatively easy-to-find quantities and available at an attractive price.

Funky and desirable, it leans medium-bodied in weight and tone, with an undeniable affront of blood orange and crisp red cherry.\t\tGT_90_Points\t25\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\tVirginie Boone\tPinot Noir\tBuena Vista 2014 Pinot Noir (Carneros)\n113807\tUS\tThis is the kind of California Pinot Noir Burgundophiles love to hate. It's so full-bodied and fruity, so forward in currant, chocolate and licorice flavors, that it seems to have nowhere to go �?? a sin in Burgundy. And yet there's no denying its immediate deliciousness. It fools the palate, now honey sweet, now bone dry, but always rich and spicy.\tProximus\tGT_90_Points\t56\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\t\tPinot Noir\tAdastra 2005 Proximus Pinot Noir (Carneros)\n69194\tUS\tThere's a sweet fruit and pastry quality to this wine that's reminiscent of a cherry tart, with its vanilla, brown sugar, cinnamon and smoky buttery pie crust flavors. It's very delicious but also brilliantly structured as a wine, with fine tannins and a sunburst of citrusy acids. One of the best Carneros Pinots of the vintage, it will provide pleasurable drinking now�??2013 at the least.\tSeven's Bench\tGT_90_Points\t60\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\t\tPinot Noir\tHartford 2007 Seven's Bench Pinot Noir (Carneros)\n46914\tUS\tThis is the producer's first vintage from Hudson, one of the most sought-after sites in the appellation, and one not widely planted to the variety. Light and lush with a velvety ripeness, this special wine shines in pomegranate, earthy truffle and a turn of smoked meat. Robust, it maintains balance amidst its brawn.\tHudson Vineyards\tGT_90_Points\t60\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\tVirginie Boone\tPinot Noir\tDavies 2014 Hudson Vineyards Pinot Noir (Carneros)\n100370\tUS\tThere's no doubt this estate-grown wine is at first funky on the nose, a mix of forest, mint and farmhouse cheese. It develops in the glass to embrace its quirks, complementing them with vibrant acidity, ripe texture, and hints of orange, rhubarb and spicy clove.\tWinery Lake Vineyard Estate Grown\tGT_90_Points\t50\tCalifornia\tCarneros\tNapa-Sonoma\tVirginie Boone\tPinot Noir\tAcacia 2013 Winery Lake Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Carneros)\n9815\tUS\tLight in color and ethereally earthy, this wine opens with delicate notes of rose petal and allspice.

A dry core sustained by the acidity is waiting to burst out and give a ripe, fruity while always fresh wine. Drink from 2018.\tClos du Roy Premier Cru\tGT_90_Points\t56\tBurgundy\tMercurey\t\tRoger Voss\tPinot Noir\tDomaine Faiveley 2014 Clos du Roy Premier Cru  (Mercurey)\n11578\tFrance\tFrom one of the highest of the Mercurey premier crus, this wine has a crisp edge to its otherwise ripe red fruits. It has a fine line of wood as well as the juicy fruitiness and acidity. The wine is already balanced, likely to develop easily and quickly. Drink this from 2019.\tLes Puillets Premier Cru\tGT_90_Points\t45\tBurgundy\tMercurey\t\tRoger Voss\tPinot Noir\tCh?�teau de Santenay 2015 Les Puillets Premier Cru  (Mercurey)\n11584\tFrance\tThis is a single-vineyard wine which is beautifully rich and already soft and smooth enough to drink. To be sure, it will age further and mellow with time, but for now it is the ripe red-berry fruits and generous tannins that are so attractive. Drink now and until 2026.\tCh?�teau de Chamirey Clos de la Maladi??re\tGT_90_Points\t40\tBurgundy\tMercurey\t\tRoger Voss\tPinot Noir\tDomaines Devillard 2015 Ch?�teau de Chamirey Clos de la Maladi??re  (Mercurey)\n15734\tUS\tThis bottling from the Scheid family, one of the region's largest growers, shows aromas of baked red cherry in a vanilla pie crust as well as marjoram, bay leaf and cinnamon. The palate balances tart and ripe cranberry and pomegranate with both dried and fresh herbs.\tRiverview Vineyard Estate Grown\tGT_90_Points\t35\tCalifornia\tMonterey\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tPinot Noir\tMetz Road 2015 Riverview Vineyard Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Monterey)\n54349\tUS\tExuberant on the nose, with aromas of fresh blossoms, luscious melon and peach, this wine is a welcome harbinger of long summer nights to come. It's rich and ripe with red cherry and berry flavor, but refreshingly brisk. A chalky minerality lingers on the finish.\tAnomaly\tGT_90_Points\t20\tNew York\tNew York\tNew York Other\tAnna Lee C. Iijima\tPinot Noir\tAnthony Nappa 2013 Anomaly Pinot Noir (New York)\n114563\tFrance\tWhile the wine is very young, the potential is there. It has rich tannins and berry fruits that are packed with youthful acidity. The structure and the depth of flavor are there with a hint of the juicy fruits as well as the minerality that are both developing. Drink from 2018.\tMaxime Cuv??e Silex\tGT_90_Points\t\tLoire Valley\tSancerre\t\tRoger Voss\tPinot Noir\tDomaine Delaporte 2014 Maxime Cuv??e Silex  (Sancerre)\n46684\tFrance\tA selection of old vines and 12 months of barrel aging have produced a ripe, full and spicy wine.

Its richness and the touches of spice and toastiness give the wine a ripe rounded character. However, it is dry, crisply textured with a touch of tannin to give it structure.

It is full bodied, very ripe and juicy, and feels smooth in texture thanks to subdued acidity and tannins.\tTwo Barrel\tGT_90_Points\t60\tCalifornia\tMendocino\t\tJim Gordon\tPinot Noir\tMas?�t 2013 Two Barrel Pinot Noir (Mendocino)\n73314\tFrance\tA massive wine, firmly structured with dense and powerful tannins. This is a wine for long-term aging, with its dark black fruits and chunky feel. It is still just starting out; cellar for 10 years.\tChambertin\tGT_90_Points\t272\tBurgundy\tChambertin\t\tRoger Voss\tPinot Noir\tCamille Giroud 2008 Chambertin  (Chambertin)\n87269\tUS\tThis wine comes from three vineyards that sit atop a dry, ancient riverbed. The nose mixes sour cherry and toasted vanilla bean with scents of ginger and turned earth, while a soft mouthfeel frames flavors of cherry cola and beet juice.\tRiverbed\tGT_90_Points\t28\tCalifornia\tArroyo Seco\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tPinot Noir\tMercy 2012 Riverbed Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco)\n72876\tUS\tPeppery herbs lead the nose on this bottling, with sagebrush, bay leaf and rust giving depth to the light cranberry and raspberry fruit. The palate is earthy with juniper and turned-loam flavors, plus more bay leaf, iron cranberry and some rhubarb.\tDelfina's Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t45\tCalifornia\tArroyo Seco\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tPinot Noir\tBlair 2013 Delfina's Vineyard Pinot Noir (Arroyo Seco)\n73622\tUS\tOne of the better deals for top-quality Pinot, Steve Dooley's entry-level bottling invites the nose with deep and dark black cherry, grape soda and even blueberry aromas, leveled by a hint of ethereal roasted game and dried sage. The purple note holds into the palate, which shows lavender and other potpourri elements.\t\tGT_90_Points\t32\tCalifornia\tEdna Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tPinot Noir\tStephen Ross 2013 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)\n114574\tUS\tBeet juice, dense pomegranate, root beer, turned earth, fire-roasted meats and toasted sagebrush aromas power the action-packed nose on this bottling by one of the appellation's bigger outfits. The palate combines juicy elderberry and bramble fruit with cedar, dried mint and wild herbs, finishing on a menthol-like sensation, with decent grip for a Pinot.\t1772\tGT_90_Points\t60\tCalifornia\tEdna Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tPinot Noir\tTolosa 2013 1772 Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)\n75344\tUS\tConsiderably riper than Baileyana's other Pinots. It shows in the richer, softer mouthfeel and deeper flavors. The red cherries veer toward blackberries, yet the texture remains silky and dry. New oak, as always, is judiciously applied. Delicious now, and should develop over the next 3�??4 years.\tLa Entrada\tGT_90_Points\t33\tCalifornia\tEdna Valley\tCentral Coast\t\tPinot Noir\tBaileyana 2007 La Entrada Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)\n68688\tUS\tDense aromas of black plum syrup, star anise and purple flowers show on the nose of this top-end bottling by a pioneering Edna Valley producer. Tart boysenberry shows on the sip, but the prominent flavors are more forest floor-driven, with woody bay leaf and juniper spices.\tMorrito Estate Grown\tGT_90_Points\t100\tCalifornia\tEdna Valley\tCentral Coast\tMatt Kettmann\tPinot Noir\tChamisal Vineyards 2014 Morrito Estate Grown Pinot Noir (Edna Valley)\n129674\tUS\tThis biodynamically farmed vineyard is often found as a named designate, and for good reason. It's one of the Willamette Valley's most distinctive and evocative sites, with less of an emphasis on pure fruit flavors, and more attention to details such as herbal tea, earth, stone and dried leaf. The fruit is tart and lightly herbal, like a fresh-picked mountain berry.\tMomtazi Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t36\tOregon\tMcMinnville\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tSt. Innocent 2014 Momtazi Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville)\n12132\tUS\tThis barrel selection brings bright flavors of salmonberry and raspberry, with highlights of citrus peel. It's precise and tart; less ripe than many wines from this warm year, but balanced and focused.\tH??ritage Reserve\tGT_90_Points\t36\tOregon\tMcMinnville\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tCoeur de Terre 2014 H??ritage Reserve Pinot Noir (McMinnville)\n60934\tUS\tBold and striking aromas of mushroom, seaweed and organic funk set this apart from the other Ken Wright vineyard designates. There's plenty of tart, tangy cherry fruit also, though it seems to hit a wall, perhaps due to the recent bottling. This is a wine that could score even higher with additional bottle age.\tMeredith Mitchell Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t50\tOregon\tMcMinnville\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tKen Wright 2008 Meredith Mitchell Vineyard Pinot Noir (McMinnville)\n3190\tUS\tFull bodied and definitely fruity without being sweet, this wine from Fulcrum comes straight at the taste buds with opulent black cherry and tart raspberry flavors on a vivid texture. Having spent 15 months in French oak before bottling, it tastes a bit dense and muted at this point, and should be best after 2018.\tChristina's Cuv??e\tGT_90_Points\t38\tCalifornia\tNorth Coast\tNorth Coast\tJim Gordon\tPinot Noir\tOn Point 2014 Christina's Cuv??e Pinot Noir (North Coast)\n65356\tFrance\tThis wine has great power along with magnificently rich fruit. Wood aging provides a judicious support to its fullness and opulence. Acidity, black cherries and red berry fruits come together with firm tannins. Combined they are already in balance, but the wine needs to wait. Drink from 2018.\t\tGT_90_Points\t480\tBurgundy\tBonnes-Mares\t\tRoger Voss\tPinot Noir\tRoche de Bellene 2011  Bonnes-Mares\n15499\tFrance\tBoth rich and opulent, this complex and dense wine is packed with the richest strawberries and a firm, black core of tannin. The velvet casing of the wine is ripe and generous while still needing many years to age. This is a wine for the long-haul, don't touch before 2020.\t\tGT_90_Points\t450\tBurgundy\tBonnes-Mares\t\tRoger Voss\tPinot Noir\tJean-Luc and Paul Aegerter 2012  Bonnes-Mares\n119927\tUS\tA Pommard clone, single-block bottling, this is the most complete and satisfying of the winery's block series of Pinots. Cinnamon toast frames a full-bodied wine loaded with blackberry fruit.\tBlock 10\tGT_90_Points\t44\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tWinter's Hill 2012 Block 10 Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)\n67399\tUS\tThough relatively young (planted in 2001) this Dundee Hills vineyard can deliver the goods. This is full, juicy, packed with ripe fruits, moderately deep in color, and limned with sharp, herbal, astringent tannins. It could profit from a bit more bottle age, to take the edge off the green tea in the finish.\tLillie's\tGT_90_Points\t50\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tErath 2007 Lillie's Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)\n27779\tUS\tNice black cherry and black currant fruit flavors are wrapped in a casing of stone and earth. This wine seems to be holding itself back, perhaps just in need of further cellaring, certainly requiring decanting. It's compact, elegant and well balanced, but shy. A pleasing streak of truffle elevates the finish.\tEstate Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t60\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tLange 2008 Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)\n27776\tUS\tVista Hills is in a sweet spot in the Dundee Hills, with neighbors including DDO and Domaine Serene. This puts the fruit front and center, a panoply of berries and melon, lightly edged with toast. Warm, forward and palate-friendly, it rolls into a finish with a hint of sassafras.\tTusculum Estate\tGT_90_Points\t44\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tVista Hills 2008 Tusculum Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)\n62779\tUS\tA limited, popular entry in Winderlea's extensive single-vineyard lineup, this suggests cherry kirsch with streaks of coffee and tobacco. The pretty fruit leads into darker notes of tar and espresso. Still young and primary, the Juliard may be among the vintage's most long-lasting wines.\tJuliard Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t48\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tWinderlea 2013 Juliard Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)\n46677\tUS\tWinderlea is the most limited and most expensive of the winery's single vineyard series. This vintage remains tight and compact�??a youthful purple in color, with fruit flavors of plum and sour cherry. Subtle layers unfold as it breathes, adding citrus peel, minerality and a touch of malt as well.\tWinderlea Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t95\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tAdelsheim 2014 Winderlea Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)\n73624\tUS\tRipe, tannic and leathery (in a good sense), this brings concentrated flavors of cherry comp??te, Campari and baking spices. It's aromatic and mouthfilling, and delivers ample pleasure.\tBlack Family Estate\tGT_90_Points\t75\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tThe Four Graces 2012 Black Family Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)\n87299\tUS\tArchery Summit's top cuv??e is young and brash, a jangle of brambly berries, threads of incense and chocolate, assertive acids and not quite integrated tannins. It will require some patience, either in the cellar, or in the decanter (hours!) but has an underlying plush texture and an exotic mix of spices that elevate the pretty fruit to the next level.\tArchery Summit Estate\tGT_90_Points\t150\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tArchery Summit 2008 Archery Summit Estate Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)\n57204\tUS\tThis blend of Pommard, Coury and Dijon 667 clones shows bright cherry fruit, bedecked with lovely spices. It's round and forward, with medium weight and depth.\tOlson Estate Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t65\tOregon\tDundee Hills\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tTorii Mor 2013 Olson Estate Vineyard Pinot Noir (Dundee Hills)\n15936\tUS\tLight-bodied and yet offering a depth of complexity, this is resplendent in rhubarb and spicy anise, layered and textured in silky waves of fleshy flavor. A well balanced and approachable selection that's enjoyable now.\tReserve\tGT_90_Points\t40\tCalifornia\tGreen Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\tPinot Noir\tMartin Ray 2012 Reserve Pinot Noir (Green Valley)\n91856\tUS\tFrom four acres at the crest of a knoll onsite, this wine is indelibly crisp in cranberry and orange. It's structured and classy, with a zesty acidity that belies the darker, deeper elements of toasted oak and Asian spice. The tannins are there, but subtle and supportive, resulting in a pretty yet substantive selection.\tWinery Block\tGT_90_Points\t85\tCalifornia\tGreen Valley\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\tPinot Noir\tIron Horse 2013 Winery Block Pinot Noir (Green Valley)\n62511\tUS\tSometimes a young Pinot is deceptive. This wine is young and silky, supple and fruity and has some sharp acidity, but it doesn't overwhelm. It's the kind of wine that doesn't overshadow food. But it's excellent Pinot. The depth of flavor and long finish suggest aging possibilities, but there's no reason not to drink and enjoy it now.\tMills Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t55\tCalifornia\tMount Harlan\tCentral Coast\t\tPinot Noir\tCalera 1997 Mills Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mount Harlan)\n114550\tUS\tThis perfectly embodies the fruit-forward, irresistibly delicious wines of the 2012 vintage in the Willamette Valley. Along with lively aromas of pepper and spice come brambly fruit flavors of just-picked raspberries and black cherries. It rolls into a lush finish with a streak of espresso.\tSignature\tGT_90_Points\t35\tOregon\tRibbon Ridge\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tStyring 2012 Signature Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge)\n108412\tUS\tThe best of the three vineyard designates in 2010, this firm and full-flavored wine is still a bit tight, and rewards extra breathing time. It tastes like a bowl full of berries and plums with pretty mocha highlights.\tRidgecrest Vineyards\tGT_90_Points\t48\tOregon\tRibbon Ridge\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tChehalem 2010 Ridgecrest Vineyards Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge)\n110173\tUS\tThis is deliciously deep, with ripe raspberry, blackberry and black cherry fruit in abundance. It retains a tart, tangy bite of acidity as well, and a touch of sweet barrel toast from aging in 30% new French oak.\tRibbon Springs Vineyard\tGT_90_Points\t68\tOregon\tRibbon Ridge\tWillamette Valley\tPaul Gregutt\tPinot Noir\tAdelsheim 2014 Ribbon Springs Vineyard Pinot Noir (Ribbon Ridge)\n38230\tUS\tA good, complex Pinot Noir that shows the dramatic structure of the far Sonoma Coast. It's rich in acidity and tannins, yet still is silky and gentle in the mouth. The cherry, raspberry, cola and sandalwood flavors are delicious.

Light in texture and weight the wine still offers a sense of place and gravitas.\t\tGT_90_Points\t40\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\tPinot Noir\tChasseur 2012 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\n79655\tUS\tThis coastal wine hails from two sites, including the Gloria Vineyard in Sebastopol, and Hummingbird Hill in the Petaluma Gap. It stays true to form in its light approach and high-toned acidity. Earthy, light in color and bristling in black tea, cranberry and pomegranate, it's lightly spiced in cardamom.\t\tGT_90_Points\t33\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\tVirginie Boone\tPinot Noir\tCellars 33 2014 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\n24459\tUS\tPower vs. finesse. Which wins out? It's pretty much a draw in this blend of various sites throughout the sprawling Sonoma Coast appellation. It shows the acidity and dryness of the coast, as well as the long hangtime richness of the vintage, with spicy raspberry and cherry flavors liberally oaked. A gorgeous wine, and a bargain given that it's the least expensive of the winery's 2010 Pinots. Drink now�??2014.\t\tGT_90_Points\t39\tCalifornia\tSonoma Coast\tSonoma\t\tPinot Noir\tMerry Edwards 2010 Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\n117867\tUS\tTwo-plus years in the cellar have softened and mellowed this wine, taking off the edges and giving it a nice roundness.

Smith 2012 Maritime Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast)\n15732\tUS\tThis is a tiny production wine, nutty on the nose in almond paste and an intensity of forest floor and earth.

With white fruits and a floral character, it is moving into spicy territory. Roast almonds are balanced with a crisp character from the low dosage. The wine is now just ready to drink.\tLe Sourire de Reims Brut\tGT_90_Points\t80\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\tChampagne Blend\tHenri Abele 2007 Le Sourire de Reims Brut  (Champagne)\n46160\tFrance\tThis special cuv??e comes from the vineyards surrounding the Ch?�teau de la Marquetterie in Reims. With a part aged in wood, the wine has fine bottle aging and toastiness giving it richness as well as bringing out the ripe lemon and red-apple flavors. It is a beautifully balanced wine that is ready to drink.\tFolies de la Marquetterie\tGT_90_Points\t97\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\tChampagne Blend\tTaittinger NV Folies de la Marquetterie  (Champagne)\n91102\tFrance\tWith its beautiful pale pink color and bright fruitiness, this delicious wine also has a good depth of texture, mineral strength and tight acidity. Even though it is now six years old, it is showing no sign of maturity, so drink from 2016.\tL'Intemporelle Brut Ros??\tGT_90_Points\t130\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\tChampagne Blend\tMailly Grand Cru 2008 L'Intemporelle Brut Ros??  (Champagne)\n113852\tFrance\tPaillard's crispest Chardonnay comes mainly from the C??te des Blancs. Offering great white fruit and bright apple flavors, this wine is also textured and mineral. It is beginning to mature, suggesting a touch of toastiness while the fruit remains. It finishes dry. Drink the wine now.\tBlanc de Blancs Extra Brut\tGT_90_Points\t87\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\tChampagne Blend\tBruno Paillard 2006 Blanc de Blancs Extra Brut  (Champagne)\n15510\tFrance\tMature, toasty aromas give this wine an immediate sophistication. It is full in the mouth, showing almonds, ripe toastiness, coffee and tight acidity. It's ripe and full-bodied while keeping a more nervy character that allows it to finish with a great lift. It's ready to drink.\tGrand Vintage Collection Brut\tGT_90_Points\t140\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\tChampagne Blend\tMo?�t & Chandon 1999 Grand Vintage Collection Brut  (Champagne)\n112240\tFrance\tTo age an extra brut vintage before release is a great idea. It leaves a wine that hints at toasty aromas as well as still-crisp fruitiness. The apple and pear flavors are filled out by the tangy edge and the hints of maturity to come. Drink this fine vintage now.\tLe Vintage Premier Cru Extra Brut\tGT_90_Points\t67\tChampagne\tChampagne\t\tRoger Voss\tChampagne Blend\tJ. Dumangin Fils 2005 Le Vintage Premier Cru Extra Brut  (Champagne)\n114043\tFrance\tThis is a classic Burgundian version of a Champagne blend�??made from Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from the cool areas around Chablis. It's bright and fruity, tangy with lemon zest and a fine streak of minerality, and finishes with an attractive, creamy edge. Drink now.\tBrut\tGT_90_Points\t19\tBurgundy\tCr??mant de Bourgogne\t\tRoger Voss\tChampagne Blend\tSimonnet-Febvre NV Brut  (Cr??mant de Bourgogne)\n16211\tNew Zealand\tThis vintage of Dog Point is unabashedly green without being overwhelming so. There's plenty of fig and melon fruit to provide support for the garlands of cut grass, tomato leaf and fresh herbs. The texture, as usual from this venture, is silky, while the finish is long and vibrant.\t\tGT_90_Points\t\tMarlborough\t\t\tJoe Czerwinski\tSauvignon Blanc\tDog Point 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)\n99615\tNew Zealand\tFormer Cloudy Bay boss Kevin Judd scores big in this challenging vintage. The wine is round, ripe and amply concentrated, with grassy, herbal shadings and pineapple and stone fruit notes that linger on the lush finish.\t\tGT_90_Points\t23\tMarlborough\t\t\tJoe Czerwinski\tSauvignon Blanc\tGreywacke 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)\n24206\tNew Zealand\tThe new project of Erica and Kim Crawford (yes, the Kim Crawford), Loveblock is situated on a spectacular windswept promontory overlooking the sea. Passion fruit, vibrant and pure, marks the nose, while the plump palate reveals hints of gooseberry that linger through the extended finish.\t\tGT_90_Points\t24\tMarlborough\t\t\tJoe Czerwinski\tSauvignon Blanc\tLoveblock 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)\n79388\tNew Zealand\tThis wine is widely distributed and often discounted, but don't shy away from it because of that�??it's really well made. Subtle herb and citrus shadings mark the nose, but so do riper hints of fig and melon. Those riper notes shape the palate, giving it breadth up front, then gently tapering into a long, elegant, citrusy finish.\t\tGT_90_Points\t20\tMarlborough\t\t\tJoe Czerwinski\tSauvignon Blanc\tWhitehaven 2014 Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)\n24204\tNew Zealand\tThis is on the full-bodied side, quite ripe and tropical in style compared to its Marlborough siblings. Mango, pineapple and stone-fruit notes are all present, balanced on the finish by citrus and ginger.\t\tGT_90_Points\t17\tMartinborough\t\t\tJoe Czerwinski\tSauvignon Blanc\tLagoon Hill 2013 Sauvignon Blanc (Martinborough)\n68928\tAustria\tThe Zieregg vineyard is on the frontier between Austria and Slovenia. The wine, fermented in wood, is in a very tight, closed style, firm, with some bitter herbs in its youth. The flavors are of white fruits, spiced with a touch of pepper. Age for 3�??4 years. Glass stopper.\tZieregg\tGT_90_Points\t\tS?�dsteiermark\t\t\tRoger Voss\tSauvignon Blanc\tManfred Tement 2008 Zieregg Sauvignon Blanc (S?�dsteiermark)\n79390\tNew Zealand\tThis combines bold fruit flavors reminiscent of peach or nectarine with leafy, herbal notes. The tomato and celery leaf tones provide a cool contrast to the ripe fruit, and a burst of crisp acids on the finish keeps the wine refreshing.\tThe Nest\tGT_90_Points\t15\tMarlborough\t\t\tJoe Czerwinski\tSauvignon Blanc\tLake Chalice 2014 The Nest Sauvignon Blanc (Marlborough)\n87783\tAustria\tWet stone, cut grass and white pepper create an appetizing nose. The palate positively sprays with refreshing, lively pepperiness and verve while the balanced body cushions its freshness in a creamy, white-pepper-scented core of pleasant lightness.\tKranachberg\tGT_90_Points\t40\tSteiermark\t\t\tAnne Krebiehl?�MW\tSauvignon Blanc\tSkoff 2014 Kranachberg Sauvignon Blanc (Steiermark)\n129922\tAustria\tHerbs, spices and green fruit aromas show the freshness of this wine. On the palate, tropical fruits, apricots and lychees also appear, fleshing out a superb Sauvignon Blanc. With its edges of apple skin tannins, it could age for 2�??3 years, but it already has huge concentration and elegance. Glass stopper.\tKranachberg\tGT_90_Points\t48\tS?�dsteiermark\t\t\tRoger Voss\tSauvignon Blanc\tSattlerhof 2006 Kranachberg Sauvignon Blanc
