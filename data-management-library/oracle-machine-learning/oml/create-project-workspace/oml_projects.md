# OracleÂ® Cloud Create Projects and Workspaces in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks
## Before You Begin

This lab walks you through the steps to create a project and a workspace in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks.

>**Note:** The initial workspaces and the default project are created by the Oracle Machine Learning service automatically when you log in to Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks for the first time. The term default applies to the last project that you work on, and it is stored in the browser cache. If you clear the cache, then there would be no default project selected. Then you must select a project to work with notebooks.

This lab explains the steps to create your own project, and optionally your workspace.

This lab takes approximately 10 minutes to complete.

### Background
A project is a container for storing your notebooks and other objects such as dashboards and so on. A workspace is a virtual space where your projects reside, and multiple users with the appropriate permission type can work on different projects. While you may own many projects, other workspaces and projects may be shared with you.

### What Do You Need?

Access to your Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks account



## Access your Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks Account

A notebook is a web-based interface for data analysis, data discovery, data visualization, and collaboration. You create and run notebooks in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks. You can access Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks from Autonomous Database.

1. From the tab on your browser with your ADW instance, click **Service Console**, then select **Development** on the left.

## Create Project in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks

To create a project:
1. On the top right corner of the Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks home page, click the project workspace drop-down list. The project name and the workspace, in which the project resides, are displayed here. In this screenshot, the project name is `USER1 Project`, and the workspace name is `USER1 Workspace`. If a default project exists, then the name of the default project is displayed here. To choose a different project, click **Select Project**.

3. In the **Name** field, provide a name for your project.


4. In the **Comments** field, enter comments, if any.


5. To choose a different workspace, click the down arrow next to the **Workspace** field and select a workspace from the
  drop-down list. Your project `Project A` is assigned to the selected workspace. In this example, the `USER1 Workspace` is selected.

6. Click **OK**. This completes the task of creating a project and assigning it to a workspace. In this example, the assigned workspace is `USER1 Workspace`.




## Create Workspace in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks
To create a workspace:

1. On the top right corner of the Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks home page, click the project workspace drop-down list and click **Select Project**. The Select Project dialog box opens.

5. In the **Comments** field, enter comments, if any.


6. Click **OK.** This completes the task of creating your workspace, and brings you back to the Create Project dialog box.


7. In the Create Project dialog box, click **OK**. This brings you back to the Select Project dialog box. Here, you
   can view all the workspace and the projects in it. The project and workspace that you created in step 3 through 6 is listed in the Select Workspace dialog box, as shown in the screenshot here.

8. Click **OK.** This completes the task of creating a project and a workspace, and assigning the project to the workspace.


9. To delete a workspace, click **Manage Workspace** in the Project Workspace drop-down list.

10. In the Manage Workspace dialog box, select the workspace you want to delete and click **Delete**.
  This deletes the selected workspace along with all the projects in it.
