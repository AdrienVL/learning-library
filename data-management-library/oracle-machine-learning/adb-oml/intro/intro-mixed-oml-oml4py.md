# Introduction

## Let's go on a journey!
Welcome to Oracle Maching Learning on the Autonomous Database. We have combined two powerful features in Oracle Machine Learning and you will have the opportunity to choose your journey or do both!  Let's get started!

### Journey A - Oracle Machine Learning on Autonomous Database

Oracle Machine Learning is a powerful technique for analyzing data, and in this sequence of labs, we will show you how to apply it to the most valuable data in your organization - existing enterprise data in Oracle Database. If you are an Oracle data professional but not a data scientist, this workshop will take you through your first machine learning project from data preparation to a successful deployment of a model integrated into an APEX application.

Choose this path and you will:
- Provision an Autonomous Database and load data into the ADW
- Create machine learning model
- Migrate machine learning model into ATP
- Use prediction in an application

Estimated Time: 2 hours

### Journey B - Oracle Machine Learning for Python on Oracle Autonomous Database
This workshop introduces you to Oracle Machine Learning for Python (OML4Py) on Oracle Autonomous Database. OML4Py supports scalable in-database data exploration and preparation using native Python syntax, invocation of in-database algorithms for model building and scoring, and embedded execution of user-defined Python functions from Python or REST APIs. OML4Py also includes the AutoML interface for automated algorithms and feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Join us for this tour of OML4Py.

Choose this path and you will:
* Learn about Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks and connect to an Oracle Autonomous Database from a Python session
* Perform Data selection and manipulation using the Transparency Layer
* Explore In-database algorithms and models
* Create Datastores to store Python objects
* Explore Embedded Python Execution
* Learn more about AutoML functionality

Estimated Time: 2 hours



### Prerequisites

- An Oracle Cloud Account. Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported
