### Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to:
* Create an OML user
* Access OML Notebooks
* Create a Zeppelin Notebook
* Connect to the Python Interpreter
* Verify Connection to the Autonomous Database

### Prerequisites

* An Oracle Free Tier, Always Free, Paid or LiveLabs Cloud Account
* Item no 2 with url - [URL Text](https://www.oracle.com).



## **STEP 1**: Create an OML User

An administrator creates a new user account and user credentials for Oracle Machine Learning in the User Management interface.
**Note:** You must have the administrator role to access the Oracle Machine Learning User Management interface. To create a user account:

1. Sign in to your OCI account, click the hamgurger on the left to open the left navigation pane, and click **Autonomous Data Warehouse.**

2. Sub step 2 with image and link to the text description below. The `sample1.txt` file must be added to the `files` folder.

    ![Image alt text](images/sample1.png "Image title")

3. Ordered list item 3 with the same image but no link to the text description below.

4. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](images/sample2.png) click **Navigation**.

5. One example with bold **text**.

   If you add another paragraph, add 3 spaces before the line.

## **STEP 2:** Access Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks

1. Sub step 1

  Use tables sparingly:

  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Some text or a link | More text  |
  | 2 |Some text or a link | More text |
  | 3 | Some text or a link | More text |

2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent 4 spaces:

    - List item 1
    - List item 2

3. Code examples

    ```
    Adding code examples
    Indentation is important for the code example to appear inside the step
    Multiple lines of code
  	<copy>Enclose the text you want to copy using the <copy> element.</copy>
    ```

4. Code examples that include variables

  	```
    <copy>ssh -i <ssh-key-file></copy>
    ```
## **STEP 3:** Create a Zeppelin Notebook

    1. Sub step 1



    2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent 4 spaces:

        - List item 1
        - List item 2

*At the conclusion of the lab add this statement:*
You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
