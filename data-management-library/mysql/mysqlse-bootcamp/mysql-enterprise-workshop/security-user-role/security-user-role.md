## Task 1: Concise Step Description
3b) MySQL Roles
Objective: Discover and Configure roles
Server: serverB
1.	Reconnect as root to create a new user

shell> mysql -u admin -p -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307

mysql> CREATE USER 'appuser2'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Welcome1!';

mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'appuser2'@'%';

2.	Now create a new role and grant it to the new user

mysql> CREATE ROLE 'app_read';
	
mysql> GRANT SELECT ON world.* TO 'app_read';

	mysql> GRANT 'app_read' TO 'appuser2'@'%';

	mysql> SHOW GRANTS FOR 'appuser2'@'%';

3.	Reconnect as appuser2 and submit some commands (you receive errors, why?)

shell> mysql -u appuser2 -p -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3307

mysql> SHOW DATABASES; 

mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM world.city;

mysql> SELECT current_role();

4.	Set the role for the user and repeat above commands

mysql> SET ROLE ALL;

mysql> SELECT current_role();

mysql> SHOW DATABASES; 

mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM world.city;

5.	We can also assign a default role to donâ€™t ask to set one after every login (you can use user or administrative session)

mysql> ALTER USER 'appuser2'@'%' DEFAULT ROLE 'app_read';
