## Introduction

Deploy a blockchain network consisting of 2 dealerships orgs and 1 admin org on OBP OCI console, configure and import APEX applicatoin to buy and sell cars on marketplace. Track amounts paid w/ built-in tokenization feature.

Estimated Lab Time: 90 minutes

### About Oracle Blockchain Platform (OBP)
Oracle Blockchain Platform is based on the Hyperledger Fabric project from the Linux Foundation, and it extends the open source version of Hyperledger Fabric in many ways.

As a preassembled PaaS, Oracle Blockchain Platform includes all the dependencies required to support a blockchain network: compute, storage, containers, identity services, event services, and management services. Oracle Blockchain Platform includes the blockchain network console to support integrated operations. This helps you start developing applications within minutes, and enables you to complete a proof of concept in days or weeks rather than months.

### Objectives

*List objectives for this lab using the format below*

In this lab, you will:
* Create a permissioned network that consists of 1 founder and 2 partner blockchain instances
* Scaffold chaincode application from a YAML spec file and write custom code
* Create, install, and instantiate a chaincode (smart contract) on peer nodes
* Upload an application template and configure APEX data sources to invoke your blockchain network

### Prerequisites (Optional)

*List the prerequisites for this lab using the format below. Fill in whatever knowledge, accounts, etc. is necessary to complete the lab. Do NOT list each previous lab as a prerequisite.*

This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle account
* [Basic understanding on Oracle Blockchain Platform] (https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/blockchain-cloud/usingoci/whats-oracle-blockchain-cloud-service.html)
* [Familiarity with Go] (https://go.dev/)
* [Familiarity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)] (https://www.oracle.com/cloud/)
* [Familiarity with APEX] (https://apex.oracle.com/en/)


*This is the "fold" - below items are collapsed by default*

4. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](images/sample2.png) click **Navigation**.

5. Example with bold **text**.

   If you add another paragraph, add 3 spaces before the line.

## Task 2: Concise Step Description

1. Sub step 1 - tables sample

  Use tables sparingly:

  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Some text or a link | More text  |
  | 2 |Some text or a link | More text |
  | 3 | Some text or a link | More text |

2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent 4 spaces:

    - List item 1
    - List item 2

3. Code examples

    ```
    Adding code examples
  	Indentation is important for the code example to appear inside the step
    Multiple lines of code
  	<copy>Enclose the text you want to copy in <copy></copy>.</copy>
    ```

4. Code examples that include variables

	```
  <copy>ssh -i <ssh-key-file></copy>
  ```
