# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will provision a 21c autonomous database instance, manage blockchain tables and rows in a blockchain table. Later, work with signatures in blockchain table in the database. Then import a simple web application using Application Express (APEX) to see how to manage the rows, verify the rows and work with Signatures for Blockchain Table from a compute instance.

Estimated Lab Time: 60 minutes
