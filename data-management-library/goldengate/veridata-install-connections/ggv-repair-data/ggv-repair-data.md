# Repair Out-of-Sync Jobs and Generate SQL Files

## Introduction
From the Finished Jobs page, you can select the out-of-sync comparisons for repair. Jobs, groups, and compare pairs can be selected for repair.

The Repair Jobs page displays a summary of all repair jobs. You can use the Filters on this page to display older repair jobs and to filter repair jobs by repair status and job name.

Oracle GoldenGate Veridata provides the Generate SQL functionality which generates SQL files for the source and target tables associated with the out-of-sync jobs. To do that, the Oracle GoldenGate Veridata generates the SQL Statements in the background and executes these SQL statements onto the target database.

You can also look at these SQL Statements before the Oracle GoldenGate Veridata executes them onto the target database, or execute these SQL statements by yourself on any of the other database tools. With the Generate Repair SQL functionality, you can generate the SQL statements for all your out-of-sync-records, and can also execute them at your convenience.

+ **Oracle GoldenGate Veridata installed**
+ **Groups and Compare Pairs have been created as described in Lab 4**
+ **Jobs have been created and executed as described in Lab 4**
