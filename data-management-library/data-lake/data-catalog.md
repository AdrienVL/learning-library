# OCI Data Catalog, OCI Data Integration and Data Assets

## Introduction

Here we will create our OCI Data Catalog and OCI Data Integration workspace first and create a couple of additional data assets along with discovering our ADW database as a data asset.

Estimated Time:15 minutes

### About Product

In this lab, we will learn more about the OCI Data Catalog which is used in enterprises to manage technical, business and operational metadata - see the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-catalog/home.htm) for more information.

We will also discuss OCI Data Integration as part of data asset ETL and you can learn more here - [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/data-integration/home.htm).

### Objectives

- Learn how to create OCI Data Catalog
- Learn how to create OCI Data Integration Workspace
- Learn how to discover and create new data assets

## Task 1: Create the OCI Data Catalog

In this task, you will create the OCI Data Catalog. Review options for creating business term to sync with the metadata for the data assets

## Task 2: Create the OCI Data Integration workspace

Creation of the OCI Data Integration workspace required the VPN, groups and policies that we configured during the setup of the environment for the Lakehouse. Now it is a matter of navigating to the Data Integration space and creating the workspace which will in turn allow us to create ETL processes.

## Task 3: Discover data assets and configure connections for new data assets

In this step, you will discover the data assets already available in the ADW and Object Storage. We will also create new data assets that we might get from another source or API.

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
