# Loading data from object storage using Data Tools (& API)

## Introduction

This lab takes you through the steps needed to load data from the MovieStream data lake on Oracle Object Store into an Oracle autonomous database instance in preparation for exploration and analysis.

You can load data into your autonomous database (Autonomous Data Warehouse [ADW] or Autonomous Transaction Processing [ATP]) using Oracle Database tools, and Oracle and 3rd party data integration tools. You can load data:

+ from files in your local device, or
+ from tables in remote databases, or
+ from files stored in cloud-based object storage (Oracle, S3, Azure, Google)

> **Note:** While this lab uses ADW, the steps are identical for loading data into an ATP database.

Estimated Time: 30 minutes

### Objectives <optional>


-   Learn how to define object store credentials for your autonomous database
-   Learn how to load data from the Object Store
-   Learn how to troubleshoot data loads


*This is the "fold" - below items are collapsed by default*

## **Step 1**: Load Data from Object Store using the Database Actions Data Load Tool

1. In your ADW database's details page, click the Tools tab. Click **Open Database Actions**

  To create a link to local file you want the reader to download, use this format:

  Download the [starter file](files/starter-file.sql) SQL code.

  *Note: do not include zip files, CSV, PDF, PSD, JAR, WAR, EAR, bin or exe files - you must have those objects stored somewhere else. We highly recommend using Oracle Cloud Object Store and creating a PAR URL instead. See [Using Pre-Authenticated Requests](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/usingpreauthenticatedrequests.htm)*

2. Sub step 2

4. Example with inline navigation icon ![Image alt text](images/sample2.png) click **Navigation**.

5. Example with bold **text**.

   If you add another paragraph, add 3 spaces before the line.

## **STEP 2:** <what is the action in this step>

1. Sub step 1 - tables sample

  Use tables sparingly:

  | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | 1 | Some text or a link | More text  |
  | 2 |Some text or a link | More text |
  | 3 | Some text or a link | More text |

2. You can also include bulleted lists - make sure to indent 4 spaces:

    - List item 1
    - List item 2

3. Code examples

    ```
    Adding code examples
  	Indentation is important for the code example to appear inside the step
    Multiple lines of code
  	<copy>Enclose the text you want to copy in <copy></copy>.</copy>
    ```

4. Code examples that include variables

	```
  <copy>ssh -i <ssh-key-file></copy>
  ```
