# Introduction

## About this Workshop

The labs in this workshop walk you through all the steps to get access the Data Lake using Autonomous Database and Data Catalog.

Estimated Lab Time: TBD minutes.

## What is Data Catalog?
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Data Catalog is a fully managed, self-service data discovery and governance solution for your enterprise data. With Data Catalog, you get a single collaborative environment to manage technical, business, and operational metadata. You can collect, organize, find, access, understand, enrich, and activate this metadata.

* Harvest technical metadata from a wide range of supported data sources that are accessible using public or private IPs.
* Create and manage a common enterprise vocabulary with a business glossary.
* Build a hierarchy of categories, subcategories, and terms with detailed rich text descriptions.
* Enrich the harvested technical metadata with annotations by linking data entities and attributes to the business terms or adding free-form tags.
* Find the information you need by exploring the data assets, browsing the data catalog, or using the quick search bar.
* Automate and manage harvesting jobs using schedules.
* Integrate the enterprise class capabilities of your data catalog with other applications using REST APIs and SDKs.
