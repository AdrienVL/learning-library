# Introduction

## About this Workshop
### Overview
*Estimated Time to complete the workshop*: 35 minutes

This workshop is the THIRD PART of the Hands-On Labs dedicated to the Oracle Database Security features and functionalities - please refer to the *DB Security Basics* for the first workshop and *DB Security Fundamentals* for the second.

Based on an OCI architecture, deployed in a few minutes with a simple internet connection, it allows you to test DB Security use cases in a complete environment already pre-configured by the Oracle Database Security Product Manager Team.

Now, you no longer need important resources on your PC (storage, CPU or memory), nor complex tools to master, making you completely autonomous to discover at your rhythm all new DB Security features.

## Objectives

In this workshop, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Provision an Autonomous Database on OCI
- Enable/Disable Database Vault in an Autonomous DB
- Protect sensitive data using a Database Vault realm
- Create an audit policy to capture realm violations
- Test Database Vault Controls with Simulation mode

The entire DB Security PMs Team wishes you an excellent workshop!

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
