# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Oracle Identity Governance(OIG) is a powerful and flexible enterprise identity management system that automatically manages user's access privileges within enterprise IT resources.

Application onboarding is the process of registering or associating an application with Oracle Identity Manager so that Oracle Identity Manager can provision or reconcile user information in or from that application.
Oracle Identity Manager provides a quick and convenient way to onboard applications by using the Applications option on the Manage tab in Identity Self Service. You can perform all the necessary configurations to onboard an application from a single console.
This simplified solution has the following benefits:
- You can configure new or existing applications by using a single user interface: Identity Self Service.
- You can export configurations as application templates and configure applications by using these templates, instead of Oracle Identity Manager.
