# Run Faceswap (terminal and GUI)

## Introduction

Now that we made sure that our GPU machine supports Tensorflow (see Lab 4), we can go ahead and run Faceswap. In the lab, you will learn to copy your training data to the compute instance, extract the faces from the training data, train the GAN with the extracted faces and to convert your video with the swapped face.

### Objectives

- Copy your training data (photos or videos with the faces you want to swap) to the compute instance
- [Extract](https://forum.faceswap.dev/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=27) the faces from the photos or videos
- [Train](https://forum.faceswap.dev/viewtopic.php?f=27&t=146) the GAN with the extracted faces
- [Convert](https://forum.faceswap.dev/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=1083) and swap face A in your source video with face B

### What Do You Need?

- Complete Lab 1 to Lab 3
- Complete Lab 4 to make sure that your GPU machine supports Tensorflow, otherwise the Faceswap GAN will not utilize the GPU
- Complete Lab 5

## **Step 1:** Copy your training data to the compute instance

We will use WinSCP

## **Step 2:** Extract the faces from the photos and videos

## **Step 3:** Train the GAN

## **Step 4:** Convert your video with the swapped face
