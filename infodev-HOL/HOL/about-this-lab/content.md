# About this Tutorial
## Before You Begin

This tutorial walks you through the steps to create a Hands-on lab (HOL) content such as tutorials and learning paths.

HOL content is created using Markdown, stored in a central GitHub repository, and can include text, images, and videos. Multiple tutorials can be combined to create a learning path.

### Background
