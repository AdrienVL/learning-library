## Introduction   
To get started, you need to have an active Oracle  account and a LiveLabs reservation. An Oracle account is free and needed to gain access to your LiveLabs reservation, Oracle Support, and other Oracle publicly-accessible content.

If you already have an Oracle account, you can skip to Step 2.

If you already have a reservation, skip to the next lab to start your workshop!
