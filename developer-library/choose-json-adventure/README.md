# Introduction

## About JSON and the Oracle Database

Did you know that the Oracle Database fully supports schema-less application development using the JSON data model? In addition, in the same database, that developers can use SQL over the same data for analytics or reporting?

This workshop will provide a walkthrough on how the Oracle Database can not only store, index and have transactional consistency (ACID) with JSON documents, but how you can leverage all the power of the database for advanced security, application development and a whole suite of Simple Oracle Document Access (SODA) APIs. 

### Objectives

-   Load JSON into the Oracle Database
-   Work with JSON in the Oracle Database with relational tables
-   Work with JSON in the Oracle Database as JSON documents
-   Provide developer endpoints for relation or schemaless application development

### Required Artifacts

-   The following lab requires an <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/" target="\_blank">Oracle Cloud account</a>. You may use your own cloud account, a cloud account that you obtained through a trial, or a training account whose details were given to you by an Oracle instructor.

### Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have completed the following labs:
* Lab: [Login to Oracle Cloud]()
* Lab: [Provision an Autonomous Database]() or have access to a 19c or greater Oracle Database


# Choose your Own JSON Adventure: Relational or Document Store

In this lab you will work with JSON in the Oracle Database with the intent of exposing the data for application development.

## **Step 1:** Connect to your Database using SQL Developer Web

## **Step 2:** Create a user for working with JSON in the Oracle Database

## **Step 3:** Load JSON into the database and work with relational tables

## **Step 4:** Load JSON into the database and work with JSON documents and collections

## **Step 5:** Expose the JSON data for application development via a REST endpoint

## **Step 6:** Extra Credit: Deploy a sample application and consume the REST endpoint

## Conclusion
 In this lab, you had an opportunity to work with JSON in the Oracle Database
