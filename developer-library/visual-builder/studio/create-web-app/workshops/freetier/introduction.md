### About Oracle Visual Builder Studio

Oracle Visual Builder Studio — aka VB Studio — is an application development platform that helps your team effectively plan and manage your application's development lifecycle, right from design and develop through test and deploy. It simplifies development for low-code developers by providing a rich visual designer, even while making the source code available for experienced programmers to modify. With integrated Git repositories that provide a collaborative environment to share and version code; Agile dashboards and issue tracking systems that help teams track progress; and automated builds for continuous integration and delivery pipelines, Visual Builder Studio is a complete solution to simplify application development and accelerate time to market.
