# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop shows how Oracle Visual Builder Studio can help you create web apps and manage your work in a collaborative team environment. You'll see how easy it is to design and develop a web app, manage its changes as part of a Git repository, and seamlessly deploy it for  users — all within a short period of time.

Oracle Visual Builder Studio—aka VB Studio—is a development platform that helps your team plan and manage your application's lifecycle, right from design and develop through test and deploy. It simplifies development for low-code developers by providing a rich visual designer, while making the source code available for experienced programmers to modify. With integrated Git repositories that provide a collaborative environment to share and version code; Agile dashboards and issue tracking systems that help teams track progress; and automated builds for continuous integration and delivery pipelines, VB Studio is a complete solution to simplify application development and accelerate time to market.
