# Create an Instance of Oracle Visual Builder  

## Introduction

This tutorial shows you how to create an instance of Visual Builder in your Cloud account.

Estimated Lab Time:  5 minutes

### Background

If you just created a new Cloud account following the instructions in Prerequisites, you must wait at least 30 minutes before you attempt to create an instance of Visual Builder.  If you already had an account, you don't need to wait.  Either way, make sure you've signed into the Oracle Cloud before proceeding.

## **STEP 1**: Create an Instance of Visual Builder

1.  On the Oracle Cloud Get Started page, click the menu in the upper left corner to display the services you can provision:
