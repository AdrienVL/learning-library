# Introduction to Skillset Tracking Application                                   

The goal of this workshop is to build a customizable application starting from a ***simple JSON file***, using an ***Autonomous JSON Database*** to store the data in ***SODA Document Collections***. The application is using ***NodeJS*** and ***SODA for NodeJS*** on the server-side, and ***OracleJET*** for the interface.

## Is it customizable?
The application presented in the following labs is based on a sample JSON file with data regarding a group of employees and details about them and their skills on certain categories of skills and areas of development. The JSON can be easily updated in order to fit any other business need.

For example, you can build up a JSON with information for an online shop if instead of having details about employees and their skills you have details about products in the shop and product specifications for each of them.

Another idea would be to have information regarding the physical stores a company owns as well as the categories of products and the product list for each store.
It's up to you to customize the JSON according to your business need.

  **Note**: See more about the JSON files and how they can be customized in **Lab 4 - Autonomous JSON Database & SODA Collections**.
