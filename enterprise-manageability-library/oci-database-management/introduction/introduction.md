# Introduction

## About this Workshop
Set up and explore Database Management features using a simulated on-premises database.

Estimated Workshop Time: 5 hours

### About Database Management
As a Database Administrator, you can use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Database Management service to monitor and manage your Oracle Databases. Database Management currently supports External Oracle Databases, which are Oracle Databases located on-premises and connected to a resource in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure External Database service. Database Management supports Oracle Database versions 11.2.0.4 and later and using Database Management you can:

* Monitor the key performance and configuration metrics of your fleet of Oracle Databases. You can also compare and analyze database metrics over a selected period.
* Group your critical Oracle Databases, which reside across compartments into a Database Group, and monitor them.
* Create SQL jobs to perform administrative operations on a single Oracle Database or a Database Group.


### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Provision a compute instance to simulate an on-premises Oracle Database.
* Set up Management agent for Database Management.
* Register the on-premises Oracle Database with the External Database service and enable Database Management.
* Monitor the key performance and configuration metrics of your fleet of Oracle Databases.
* Monitor and administer the on-premises Oracle Database.
